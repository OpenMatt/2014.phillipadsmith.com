<p class="lead">Consensus is that consumers can save by eliminating their reliance on cable companies and using Internet services instead. The story with mobile is moving in that direction too.</p>

When I hit the ground in Canada in August, [I wrote that the mobile phone carrier I was using offered me a free gigabyte of data](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2013/08/living-on-a-gigabyte-of-data-is-kinda-like-moving-into-a-bigger-apartment.html); little did I know that my total mobile bill for eight weeks would end up being $10. 

Just to finish that story line, here's what happened: 

* As foretold, 30 days after the carrier in question offered me a free gigabyte of data, that freebie expired. So, now what?
 
* Moments after the plan expired, when I tried to access the Internet on my phone, the carrier provided me with some convenient pay-as-you-go options for data: a day pass, a weekly pass, and low-and-behold, a 30-day pass -- 250MB of data for $10. 

I've been using a data monitoring program on my iPhone for some time now, and I know that 250MB of data is actually more than sufficient for the amount of data that I use when I'm not in a location that has free WiFi. 

Typically, my data use it limited to checking e-mails, sending/receiving iMessages, the occasional Google Map lookup, and making/receiving VOIP calls or sending/receiving SMS messages through the [RingCentral app](http://www.ringcentral.com/office/features/rcmobile/app_iphone.html). Had I used up the 250MB in that four-week window in Toronto, I could have topped up with another 250MB for $10 to get me through. But, as luck would have it, that wasn't necessary.

I've had my account with my mobile carrier in Canada for many, many years now -- I'd guess 12 or 13 years -- and I've been out of any type of contract since at least 2010. I buy my phones straight out and unlocked, and I typically travel with three of them (iPhone/Android/Blackberry). To keep my account active with the carrier, I have to pay a nominal "seasonal plan" fee of about $6/month. In the past, I've done this to ensure that I've got some negotiating leverage when I return to Toronto in the summers, because -- typically -- the plan I was on the summer before is no longer offered. However, having tested the water of living on just data service and NO MOBILE MINUTES OR SMS PACKAGES for eight weeks, _I'm ready to cut the cord_. 

Before I hit the road to South America in 2009, my monthly mobile phone bill was typically $300, including lots of airtime for conference calls, long distance for Canada and the US, and -- of course -- mobile data. By the time I left for Mexico in 2011, I had gotten that monthly bill down to about $150. Now, in Mexico, my monthly pre-paid (no contract!) plan is 200 pesos ($17 CAD) including several hours of mobile calling to the US and Canada, which I rely on because the data networks in Mexico are not quite the same as in lands more northern. And, now, in Canada, it seems that I can survive nicely on a pay-as-you-go data plan for about $10-20/month, depending on usage. 

To me, that seems about right.
