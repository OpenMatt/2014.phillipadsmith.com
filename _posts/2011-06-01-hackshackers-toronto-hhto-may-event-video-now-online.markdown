In case you missed it, [I've uploaded video](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL8A4F9B3785491A8D) of the presentations from the [fifth Hacks/Hackers Toronto event on May 30, 2011](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/events/16131421/). (They're a bit dark, I'm afraid, but the audio is good.)

This was the largest and most successful Hacks/Hackers Toronto event to date. My compliments to this month's lead host, [Kim Fox](http://twitter.com/kimfox), for the excellent work pulling all of the pieces together, finding the speakers, and getting the word out.

[Ivor](https://twitter.com/#!/ivortossell), [Kim](https://twitter.com/#!/kimfox), [Mason](https://twitter.com/#!/thismason), and I will be meeting in the coming weeks to chart a course for [Hacks/Hackers Toronto](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/) through to the end of 2011. If you have any suggestions, feel free to [let us know](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/messages/boards/).
