title: Genius or Spam? Campaign for Liberty's interesting "win back" e-mail campaign
date: '2010-07-12 15:59:10 -0500'
excerpt: "Over the years, I've subscribed to hundreds of e-mail lists. Like many of
  my colleagues in the online campaigning world, I subscribe to get a feel for how
  different organizations handle their online communication strategy. During the US
  Presidential election in 2008, I was subscribed to more than ever -- and I enjoyed
  every missive! -- however, when the election was over I unsubscribed, no longer
  wanting to hear from McCain, Ron Paul, and so on.\r\n\r\nA year and eight months
  passed ... and then, today, I received the e-mail below. \r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of
  e-mail and I work with many organizations to help grow their lists by reducing list
  attrition (unsubscribes) -- so my first reaction was \"this is pretty smart.\" However,
  as I had a chance to read further and realize that I'd simply been re-subscribed
  to the list without permission, I was less enthusiastic. Now, frankly, I'm not the
  kind to get my knickers in a knot about this kind of thing (as it is easy enough
  to re-unsubscribe), but I bet that many others would. What do you think? Genius
  or Spam?\r\n\r\n(Click for larger version.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4786433347_9a022eb548_o.png\"><img
