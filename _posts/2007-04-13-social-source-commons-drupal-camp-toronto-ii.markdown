excerpt: |-
  <p>Big week in nerd world! </p>

  <p>First, the exciting re-launch of the <a href="http://www.socialsourcecommons.org">Social Source Commons</a>. This platform has been a work in progress for over a year now, under the of astute guidance of <a href="http://aspirationtech.org/about">Aspiration</a>. In their own words:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Social Source Commons is a place to share lists of software tools that you already use, gain knowledge and support, and discover new tools. It’s a place to meet people with similar needs and interests and answer the question: what tools do they use?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The re-launch incorporates lots of improvements, including a user interface overhaul, new "Community Toolboxes" that allow users to share lists, and greatly enhanced searching, tracking, and browsing. Not to mention, the darn thing is way cooler than it was before. Yeah <a href="http://aspirationtech.org/about/people">Gunner</a> -- nice work!</p>

  <p>Next up: <a href="drupalcamptoronto.org/">DrupalCampTorontoII</a></p>

  <p>Just announced, DrupalCampTorontoII will take place on May 11 - 12 at the <a href="http://www.greatspaces.utoronto.ca/projects/bahen.htm">Bahen Centre</a>. This two-day event will attract over 100 participants -- both Drupal "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie">newbies</a>" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja">ninjas</a> -- from far and wide. There will be sessions for all experience levels, great parties, t-shirts, and, well, that's about it. </p>

  <p>If you've ever had the slightest interest in learning more about <a href="http://drupal.org">one of the world's most popular open-source content management systems</a>, or if you are currently managing a Drupal site -- or several of them! -- and want to know more, or if you've been working with Drupal for years and experience to share with others, this is the event for you. </p>

  <p>Go get <a href="http://drupalcamptoronto.org/node/add/registration">registered</a> today. Space is limited to 150 participants and it will go <strong>fast</strong>. </p>

  <p>That's it for this week: over and out.</p>
