You can <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/pages/crm-rfp">read the full RFP</a> on their Web site. Quick summary is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Democracy Now! seeks to implement a Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) system using CiviCRM to manage constituent relationships with donors and prospects, activists, stations, webstore customers, volunteers, and other constituents. </p>
  
  <p>The overarching objective of the project is to increase the effectiveness of Democracy Now!'s global website and e-communications for both internal users (i.e. Democracy Now! Development and Outreach staff) as well as external users (i.e independent media consumers). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that short expressions of interest are due by March 3rd. Great endorsement of <a href="http://www.civicrm.org">CiviCRM</a> by an award-winning news program that is now broadcast on over 800 radio and television stations worldwide. </p>
