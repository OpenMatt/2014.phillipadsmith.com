<p>Mozilla's trajectory toward media, news, and journalism is not new. Recent experiments -- like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/01/experimenting-with-sotu-and-html5.html">collaborations with PBS Newshour</a> to add a layer of analysis to the recent State of the Union, or enabling the New York Times Lede blog to embed crowd-sourced translations of an <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/subtitled-video-of-wael-ghonims-emotional-tv-interview/">interview with Egyptian protester, Wael Ghonim</a> -- are just the tip of the iceberg. </p>

<p>Back in the summer of 2009, Mozilla quietly got to work on <a href="http://drumbeat.org">Drumbeat</a> as a way to encourage millions of people to act as stewards of the open Web by explaining and protecting the Internet as a critical public asset. Just a short time later, Drumbeat has helped to grow some critical pieces of the puzzle, like <a href="http://processing.org">Processing.js</a>, <a href="http://universalsubtitles.org">Universal Subtitles</a>, and <a href="http://webmademovies.org/">Web Made Movies / Popcorn.js</a>. </p>

<p>Here's a quick run-down of each and some thoughts on their catalytic potential when mixed with news, journalism, and public media: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Processing.js</strong>: is a port of the <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing Visualization Language</a> to JavaScript. The initial heavy lifting was done by none other than <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/">John Resig</a> (the person behind so many great JavaScript projects, like JQuery) and has subsequently <a href="http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/seneca-students-work-with-mozilla-to-build-a-3d-web/142140">been pushed toward 1.0 by students at Seneca College</a> here in Toronto with the support of Mozilla. As news organizations continue to build out their skills in data journalism and information visualization, it is open-source and Web-first tools like Processing.js and <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protivis</a> that will make these efforts available across a variety of devices and platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universal Subtitles</strong>: Launched in 2010, this is an ambitious project to make it possible for almost anyone to subtitle almost any online video -- enabling people to communicate with each other across language barriers. In a short period of time, Universal Subtitles has been adopted by organizations like Wikipedia, the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, and -- most recently -- is being found on sites like the <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/subtitled-video-of-wael-ghonims-emotional-tv-interview/">New York Times Lede blog</a>. This last example shows the opportunity for news organizations, as the Internet facilitates access to a more global audience, to engage more people in the work of making information broadly available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web Made Movies / Popcorn.js</strong>: Last but far from least, I wanted to highlight the amazing work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gaylor">Bret</a> and the team working on Web Made Movies. <a href="http://webmademovies.org/">Web Made Movies</a>, is an open video laboratory researching the intersection of video and the Web and Popcorn.js is one of its first products. Popcorn.js enables publishers to add a rich layer of semantic data to online videos. I can imagine the example referenced above -- the PBS coverage of the State of the Union -- extended to <a href="http://openvault.wgbh.org/">large public media archives</a>, or used for near-live events like the ongoing state senate coverage done by upstarts like <a href="http://theuptake.org/">The Uptake</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These three technologies alone have the potential to liberate volumes of online video from a closed-format prison, and -- instead -- to enshrine video as a first-class citizen of the open Web: searchable, semantically rich, and -- thus -- interactive. </p>

<p>I share this with you because I want everyone to have a context for the type of state-change that Mozilla is thinking about in the media ecosystem. The examples above are just the beginning: when I had the chance to sit down with <a href="http://benmoscowitz.com">Ben Moscowitz</a> last week (Ben's the new Chief of Cat-herding for Drumbeat "media" projects) and he was quick to point out that there is a lot more in the Drumbeat pipeline for media, like <a href="http://yoyodyne.cc/hindenburg/">Hyper Audio</a>, <a href="http://yoyodyne.cc/hindenburg/">OpenAttribute</a> and <a href="http://yoyodyne.cc/hindenburg/">Privacy Icons</a>, not to mention the amazing line-up of no-cost, peer-led, courses for anyone -- including journalists -- at the <a href="http://yoyodyne.cc/hindenburg/">School of Webcraft</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize, Mozilla is hard-core committed to playing in the media space. The <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/02/07/knight-mozilla-news-technology-partnership-announced/">Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership</a>&nbsp;feeds into this commitment, and will push it further than we can imagine today. If you can also imagine a fun, generative, future for <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/msurman/media-freedom-and-the-web">Media, Freedom, and the Web</a>, I hope that you'll take a moment to <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-mojo">get involved</a>.  </p>

<p>P.S. Here's a quick example of Universal Subtitles that Ben, Nathan, and I put together last Friday that attempts to explains the "MoJo" project for Mozillians in under four minutes. </p>
