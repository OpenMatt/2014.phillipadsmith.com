  <p>I have to admit that when I first heard of Internet-based virtual worlds like <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> some years ago, I didn't rush out to sign-up and create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatars">Avatar</a>. Given that I've never even found the time to play a video game on a computer that I've had for three years, it certainly wasn't high on my list. And, when <a href="http://webofchange.com">Web of Change</a> alumni <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/about.php">Darren Barefoot</a> created the satirical site <a href="http://www.getafirstlife.com/">Get a First Life</a>, I was laughing pretty hard.  </p>

  <p>However, the last few months has started to make me re-think my position. Not entirely, but a bit. </p>

<p>I have to admit that when I first heard of Internet-based virtual worlds like <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> some years ago, I didn't rush out to sign-up and create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatars">Avatar</a>. Given that I've never even found the time to play a video game on a computer that I've had for three years, it certainly wasn't high on my list. And, when <a href="http://webofchange.com">Web of Change</a> alumni <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/about.php">Darren Barefoot</a> created the satirical site <a href="http://www.getafirstlife.com/">Get a First Life</a>, I was laughing pretty hard.  </p>

<p>However, the last few months has started to make me re-think my position. Not entirely, but a bit. 
<!--break-->
Last fall I started working with the team at one of Canada's most established independent online news sites -- <a href="http://www.rabble.ca">rabble.ca</a> -- to help them explore a strategy (and a new look) for the next five years. One of the newer visionaries at rabble.ca (and there are many) is <a href="http://w8nc.com">Wayne McPhail</a>, a founder of the <a href="http://rabble.ca/rpn">rabble podcast network</a>. Not happy to sit back and just produce a <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/rpn/wos">number</a> of <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/rpn/ott">quality</a> <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/rpn/diy">podcasts</a>, Wayne has continued to blaze a trail for rabble -- this time right into Second Life.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, I've watched Wayne:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a permanent piece of land for rabble in Second Life (and even virtual land doesn't come for free!);</li>
<li>Build a physical structure for rabble (Wayne used some basic platform objects to make a very cool, modular tree house);</li>
<li>Create an announcement for the <a href="http://freshtakes.typepad.com/sl_communicators/2007/03/rabbleca_and_wi.html">upcoming Don Tapscott talk in Second Life</a> (exclusive to rabble);</li>
<li>Engineer a fully functioning podcast chair for Second Life. It highlights the three latest rabble radio shows with links to the archives, the main rpn page and rabble.ca.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are a number of photos that Wayne has taken throughout the process. </p>

<img src="/files/rabble-5-small.jpg" />

<p>I must admit: the process is fascinating! And though I'm not quite ready to take the plunge myself, several of my <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/nptech%2Bsecondlife">non-profit tech colleagues have hopped right in</a>. And, as I work through the design and strategy challenges around the upcoming re-launch of rabble.ca, I'm forced to think about the opportunities around Second Life and how to integrate it into a Web site &amp; online strategy. </p>

<p>Ideas welcome.  ;-)</p>
