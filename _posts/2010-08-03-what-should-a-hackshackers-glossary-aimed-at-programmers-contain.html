Just posted this question on the <a href="http://help.hackshackers.com">Hacks/Hackers help site</a>:&nbsp;<div><br /></div><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div><div>The current <a href="http://hackshackers.com/resources/hackshackers-survival-glossary/">Hacks/Hackers glossary</a> is a fantastic resource, but it's a resource focused on providing <i>non-programmers</i> with a reference for (mostly) technical terminology.</div></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div><div>So the question is:<b> Should there be a glossary that tries to introduce terms from the journalism world to the hackers? If so, what terms should it contain?</b></div></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div><div>For example, I'm not thinking so much of historical "lingo" -- e.g.: slug, cutline, deck, etc. (though, that should probably be included also) -- but more about newer terminology that is developing around new forms of journalism practice, both in print and online.</div></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div><div>Perhaps a glossary like this exists already? Either way, if it's an idea with legs, it would be great to put such a resource into an editable form, as the current Hacks/Hackers glossary has done.</div></div><div><br /></div></blockquote>Your wisdom is requested: <a href="http://help.hackshackers.com/questions/645/what-should-a-hacks-hackers-glossary-aimed-at-programmers-contain">please post your thoughts here</a>.&nbsp;
