excerpt: "<p>Our \"Left Coast\" friends over at <a href=\"http://groundwire.org\">Groundwire</a>
  (formerly ONE/Northwest) have <a href=\"http://groundwire.org/blog/a-roundup-of-2010-conferences\">just
  posted a great roundup of events</a> in 2010 that any self-respecting \"technologist
  for good\" should check out. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are a lot of conferences on
  that list that are new to me, so I'm looking forward to digging into the agendas
  and asking for feedback from folks that have attended in the past.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>There
  are a few events not on Groundwire's list that caught my eye this year. I provide
  them with the caveat that I haven't personally attended these, and most haven't
  announce follow-up events yet. Here's to hoping they do:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.momentumconference.org/conference/index.html\">Tide's
  Momentum conference</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://fairsay.com/events/ecampaigning-forum/2009/front-page\">Fairsay's
  eCampaigning Forum in Oxford</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://journalismthatmatters.org/content/about-journalism-matters\">Journalism
  That Matters</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://organizing20.org/about/\">Organizing
  2.0</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://ignite.oreilly.com/\">A local \"Ignite\" events</a></li>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://www.aspirationtech.org/event\">And, finally, any one of the great
  events that are run by Aspiration Technology Foundation ever year</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There
  are more, but I'll leave it there.</p>\r\n<p>Know of others? Post a comment over
