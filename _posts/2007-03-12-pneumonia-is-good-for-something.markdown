title: Pneumonia is good for something

excerpt: |-
  <p>After a couple of weeks of fighting off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> -- antibiotics, inhaler, and all -- I'm finally feeling like I'm getting back on my feet. Though I never feel very productive when I'm sick -- I did have time to jot down a few Web sites of recent note:</p>

  <p>Total accident that I stumbled on <a href="https://www.copilot.com/">Fog Creek Copilot</a>: Wow! What a great little subscription-based application for remote desktop assistance. Works on Windows or Macintosh computers. It looks simple to set-up, and the price is right.</p>

  <p>I think that <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/">OpenCongress</a> caught everyone's attention recently. Yet another great "Politics 2.0" project from the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>. OpenCongress brings together official government data with news and blog coverage to give you the real story behind each bill.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.stikkit.com/">stikkit</a> just <em>stuck</em> for me during a little Web 2.0 application search. This is a crazy little Web-baed productivity application that <a href="http://justatheory.com/">David Wheeler</a> -- the lead <a href="http://bricolage.cc">Bricolage</a> developer -- is involved in. </p>

  <p>Of course Brad -- my fun-loving BSD friend -- pointed me to the <a href="http://bsdnetwork.org/wordpress/">BSD Network CLI</a>. It's one of the most interesting "themes" for Wordpress that I've come across. The world of Web 2.0 never ceases to amaze me. Basically, this is a command-line interface for reading a blog via a Web browser. Type "help" to get a list of available commands.</p>

  <p>I can't remember where I first saw <a href="http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/">One Percent for the Planet</a> -- but it seems to be catching on. One Percent for the Planet is an alliance of companies that recognize the true cost of doing business and donate 1% of their sales to environmental organizations worldwide.</p>

  <p>Adam tipped me off to <a href="http://www.cheatneutral.com/">CheatNeutral</a> -- a good satirical campaign about carbon offsetting. And <a href="http://drupal.org/user/58704">Colan Schwartz</a> tipped me to <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a> in <a href="http://silcnet.org/">SILC</a>.</p>

  <p>So, there you go: being sick is totally boring.  ;-)</p>
