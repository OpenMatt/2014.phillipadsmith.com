excerpt: " \r\n<p>\r\n\tThis just in from Steve Anderson via <a href=\"http://www.openmedia.ca\">OpenMedia.ca</a>:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe
  CRTC is currently reconsidering the role of community television in Canada, providing
  an historic opportunity to create a rejuvenated, FRESH and innovative independent
  media system. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tMany people are unaware that two per cent
  of what cable companies collect from their customers monthly is supposed to be spent
  on community channels. BUT, rather than provide community access to these resources
  as they should, cable operators have used these channels and funds to give themselves
  a competitive edge, and at times even pocketing the money while shutting down studios.
  Tell the CRTC what you think of this: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ycf3uo5\">http://tinyurl.com/ycf3uo5</a>
  \r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tOpenMedia.ca supports a proposal by CACTUS (Canadian
  Association of Community Television Users and Stations) calling for the millions
  of dollars already being collected by cable companies for community TV, be liberated
  to independent media centres for use by all Canadians. The CRTC can make this a
  reality &ndash; please send them a letter now! HERE: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ycf3uo5\">http://tinyurl.com/ycf3uo5</a>
  \r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe best part of CACTUS&rsquo; plan is that Canadians
  won't have to pay another dime! The money we are already paying to cable companies
  will be directed to independent media! \r\n\t</p>\r\n</blockquote>"
