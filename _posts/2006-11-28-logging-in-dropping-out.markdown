  city</a> has to offer, but not having enough time to enjoy it. Many folks I know
  have taken to living and working in smaller communities -- can't say that it doesn't
  have its appeal. That said, I'm just back from a few days in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence%2C_Missouri\">Independence,

  Thanksgiving</a> and saw the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Christ\">Community

  that small  just yet.</p>\n\n<p>What are your strategies for making the most of
  your urban existence? Or for staying sane in the rural experience? </p>"
