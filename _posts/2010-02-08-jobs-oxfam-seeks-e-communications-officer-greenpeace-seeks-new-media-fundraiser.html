Looks like 2010 is going to be a great year for those looking to align their politics with their work. These two job announcements -- one in <a href="http://www.oxfam.ca/what-you-can-do/work-for-oxfam/work-opportunities/e-communications-officer">Ottawa</a> and one in <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/job-opportunities/new_media_fundraiser2010">Toronto</a> -- came across my desk on Friday:<div><br /></div><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><a href="http://www.oxfam.ca/what-you-can-do/work-for-oxfam/work-opportunities/e-communications-officer"><b>E-Communications Officer</b></a></blockquote><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><b>Oxfam Canada</b> is an international development agency with a focus on women's rights and gender equality, committed to building lasting solutions to global poverty and injustice by advocating for fundamental social change.

If you've been looking for a chance to align your work and your passions, you better dust off that CV.&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;</div></div>
