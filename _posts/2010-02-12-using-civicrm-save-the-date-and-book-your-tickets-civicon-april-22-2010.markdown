excerpt: "<p>This just in from Donald Lobo and the <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/\">CiviCRM</a>
  team:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>Hey folks:</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>Just wanted to
  let you know that we'll be having our very first CiviCon on April 22 at Mitch Kapor
  Foundation offices. We hope to see all of you at the conference. \r\n\tSave the
  date and book your tickets: CiviCon, April 22, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <p>Information
  and registration is <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=37\">here</a>.
  Please register as soon as possible :)</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Would be great if folks
  could propose a few sessions <a href=\"http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/CiviCon+April+2010+Session+Proposals\">here</a>.
  We'd love to organize the conference into various tracks (fundraising, advocacy/political,
  membership/association, education). The success of the conference depends on our
  combined involvement.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>We are also having quite a few trainings
  around that time in Atlanta, GA around NTEN (April 7, 11, 12). There is an affinity
  group session and panel discussions around CiviCRM during NTEN. </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>We
  are also having trainings the day before DrupalCon April 18. </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>If
  you are in the area or attending either of those conferences, we could use your
  help. Please contact us via email.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>A complete list of our events
  is <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/civicrm/event/ical?reset=1&amp;page=1&amp;html=1\">here</a></p>\r\n
  \ \r\n  <p>lobo</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Exciting to see a product evolve
  so far in such a short timeframe. If I recall correctly, <a href=\"http://drupal.org/node/29603\">my
  own introduction to CiviCRM began on the Kleercut campaign in 2005</a>. It's been
  a reliable friend several times since then and just keeps on improving. Kudos to
  all the folks that make this open-source software project possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
  is one event that I might just have to attend. If you're considering CiviCRM for
  your organization, you might want to think about it too. </p>"
