  <p>Okay, here's an objective for your organization, or publication, this year: </p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>On Feb 23rd at 6:57 AM,  the Walrus Magazine -- a general interest magazine about Canada -- <a href="http://twitter.com/walrusmagazine?page=116">joined Twitter and had <strong>zero</strong> followers</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>On Feb 24th at 7:23 PM, <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/twitter-done-right-by-walrusmagazine">I wrote a blog post</a> about being impressed by their approach. They had less than 50 followers when I wrote that post citing their witty and fun take on how to "do Twitter."</p></li>
  <li>Today, <a href="http://twitter.com/walrusmagazine/status/4086035333">they posted this Tweet</a> "<strong>Alright, let's get to 4,000 followers, shall we? RT this and be entered to win a free subscription.</strong>" </li>
  <li>Now they have more than 4000 followers. (Translation: more than 4000 <em>real people</em> who <strong>want</strong> to hear from them: marketing, promotions, contests, and all.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The person behind the Walrus Twitter account is a someone I know in Toronto; a writer, editor, and a generally witty and smart person, but not a "social media guru" (by profession, at least). This person also has a "regular" -- i.e.: important and traditional -- job at The Walrus. I mention that to emphasize that the "Twittering" is part of the job, not something done on the side.</p>

  <p>With some focus, the Walrus has grown its following in just six short months. They have gone from <strong>zero</strong> to more than 4000 followers. If ever there were a model of how to "do Twitter right" for a magazine, this is it. </p>

  <p>If your organization or publication is interested in marketing with <em>smarts</em> not $s, take note. (And fire your "social media guru.")</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It was pointed out (on Twitter) that another Canadian magazine -- <a href="http://twitter.com/besthealthmag">Best Health Magazine</a> -- has managed to grow their following to more than 7,000 in just ten months. Ain't Canada great?</p>
