	I was hunting around for some "Top 100" lists of various types of Web sites and blogs -- specifically, I was hoping to find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> files to use in a new aggregator I'm toying around with -- and I was sad to find out that Dave Winer's <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/23/shareopmlorgRetired.html">Share OMPL</a> project had been retired. Nonetheless, I kept digging and found a relatively recent list of the "<a href="http://newsblog1st.blogspot.com/2009/10/top-100-opml-web-and-tech-blog-feed.html">Top 100 Web and tech blogs</a>." Unfortunately, it didn't appear like there was an OMPL file for the list. <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/files/100-tech-feed-subscriptions.xml">Now there is</a> (Right-click and choose "Download file," then import it into your favourite RSS reader). Enjoy. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Download an <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/files/100-tech-feed-subscriptions.xml">OPML for the Top 100 Web and technology blogs</a> (Right-click and choose "Download file," then import it into your favourite RSS reader).</p>
