The "knowledge engine" is often the first place I turn to when doing research, and -- with the release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::WolframAlpha">WWW::WolframAlpha</a> -- I've enjoy poking around at the&nbsp;Wolfram|Alpha API and pondering how this could be useful to the organizations that I work with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I may be a few days late on this, but I found an <a href="http://msgcache.wolfram.com/widget/2010/07/2035551/">e-mail in my Inbox</a> from Friday announce "<a href="http://developer.wolframalpha.com/widgets/tour.html">Wolfram|Alpha Widgets</a>" and -- after playing around for a few minutes today -- I must say that they're pretty darn neat.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Though I'm anxious to try building a few myself, there are some great widgets already in their wdiget gallery -- for example, have a look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.wolframalpha.com/widgets/gallery/view.jsp?id=69015e960fad382850623ea5853d7e6c">Energy Analysis</a> widget to chart your country's energy production vs. consumption.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, yep, that's it.
