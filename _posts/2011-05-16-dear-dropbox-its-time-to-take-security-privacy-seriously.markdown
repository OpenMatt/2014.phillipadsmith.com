I'm leaving [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). I've been using Dropbox for less than a year, and I'm going to ask for a refund because I feel deceived. You may also want to think twice about storing your personal or organizational files with a company that [is less-than-forthcoming about their security practices](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/).

This weekend, I had the opportunity to meet and connect with a number of online privacy and security researchers at the [Cyber-surveillance in Everyday Life](http://conferences.sscqueens.org/index.php/csiel/csiel) conference.

One of the people I met was online privacy researcher [Christopher Soghoian](http://www.dubfire.net/). Christopher recently revealed, among other things, that [Facebook hired a PR firm to smear Google's reputation on privacy and security](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/facebook-google-smear_n_860942.html).

Friday morning, I read about Christopher's latest findings on Wired's Threat Level: [Dropbox Lied to Users About Data Security, Complaint to FTC Alleges](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/). Admittedly, this wasn't entirely new news to me, as I head heard rumblings of this online a week or so ago. However, discussing the implications with Christopher and others over Dim Sum on Sunday really brought the issue into focus.

What's the issue? **Dropbox can -- at will or whim -- read the files that users have entrusted to them, and they obfuscated that fact prior to April 2011.**

While I don't believe that I'm currently a 'person of interest' that needs to secure every last 'bit' of my data from the watchful eyes of my government, I **do believe that basic security is the responsibility of every Internet citizen** (and, frankly, every Internet software company too). My day-to-day computer contains files entrusted to me by clients, friends, and family that they wouldn't want shared with the world.

In doing research on my [ultimate data backup triple-play for under $500](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2010/08/the-ultimate-data-backup-triple-play-for-under-500.html), I was careful to ensure that each copy of the files to be backed up were encrypted at their destination, and on route to that destination. So, when I started to look at 'cloud storage' solutions earlier this year, those same security concerns were a top priority.

Just the most basic requirements -- encryption on route to the provider, and the encryption of the files themselves -- ruled out many, many providers like Apple's iDisk (part of their Mobile Me package). However, I eventually settled on Dropbox because they **promised** these minimum security measures (or so I was lead to believe -- and, trust me, I read and re-read those pages several times before signing up).

It turns out that the real Dropbox story is quite different:

* [Dropbox Mobile: Less Secure Than Dropbox Desktop](https://grepular.com/Dropbox_Mobile_Less_Secure_Than_Dropbox_Desktop)
* [Dropbox Lied to Users About Data Security, Complaint to FTC Alleges](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/)

The tdlr; version is: Dropbox's mobile clients are insecure by design (to achieve speed over security, in Dropbox's own words) and that Dropbox will, at their discretion, hand over my data, completely unencrypted, to a third-party. Given that Dropbox is located in the US, not Canada, this isn't an acceptable level of risk.

As soon as I've had a chance to hear back from Dropbox on  my formal request for a refund, I'll be closing my Dropbox account and investing that money in a company that takes their customers security seriously.

Who will that company be? Well, I'm glad you asked. That will be the topic of an upcoming post.
