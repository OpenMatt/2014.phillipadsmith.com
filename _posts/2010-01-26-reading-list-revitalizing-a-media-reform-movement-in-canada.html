This just in from the good folks at <a href="http://OpenMedia.ca">OpenMedia.ca</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
OpenMedia.ca <a href="http://openmedia.ca/revitalize">has released a report</a> entitled "<a href="http://openmedia.ca/revitalize">Revitalizing a Media Reform Movement in Canada</a>," which is focused on the potential for a broader movement for media change in Canada. The report is the result of an in-depth <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Science_Research_Council" title="Social Science Research Council" rel="wikipedia">Social Science Research Council</a>-funded study, a collaboration between Simon Fraser University Communications Professor Robert Hackett, OpenMedia.ca and the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Association_for_Christian_Communication" title="World Association for Christian Communication" rel="wikipedia">World Association for Christian Communication</a> (WACC).

<p>
The objective of this research project was to identify issues, allies, resources and frames that could facilitate successful media reform campaigns, projects and partnerships. The research shows that there is definitely potential for a much stronger network and movement for change in media and telecommunications in Canada.</p></blockquote><br /><div>I've only skimmed <a href="http://openmedia.ca/revitalize">the report</a> quickly, but would recommend it to anyone working on media reform in Canada. The four pages of references at the end of the report are a worthy exploration on their own.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Happily adding this to my pile of things to read on the 18-hour bus journey from Buenos Aires to&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; ">Asunci√≥n</span>, Paraguay this Friday.)</div>
