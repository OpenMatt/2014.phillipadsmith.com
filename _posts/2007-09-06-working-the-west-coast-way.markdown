<p>Have you ever asked yourself the question: Just how portable is my work? Before heading out last week -- the first leg of a four-week, west-coast journey with Melanie --  I asked that question repeatedly with increasing anxiety and trepidation. Now that I've safely landed in a <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">workers' paradise</a> in downtown Vancouver, I can honesty answer that question and say: <em>yep, my work is pretty portable.</em>

<p>Though I've spent time traveling and working many times before, this time I decided to give the "<a href="http://coworking.pbwiki.com/">co-working</a>" scene a try along the way. Those of you who've been to the Community Bandwidth office in Toronto, which is nestled in the cozy womb of the <a href="http://www.socialinnovation.ca">Centre for Social Innovation</a>, have probably had a taste of the co-working movement. Though, undoubtedly, the <a href="http://www.abetterplacetowork.com">Workspace Cafe</a> in downtown Vancouver is by far the most individualistic workspace that I've visited (and I mean that in the most complimentary way).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/sets/72057594106379167/">Bill MacEwan</a> described an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kk/sets/72057594106379167/">early vision of the space</a> that was free of "anchor tenants," or other larger groups of workers that can tend  to detract from the hip, nomadic feel of dedicated co-working space. And, for sure, this experiment is in every way a success; from the overly helpful coffee baristas / space animators, to the constantly-changing faces of polite and busily working people. And then, of course, there is the view. It's hard to not be surprised every time I look up from the glowing screen to see ocean and mountains so close that I can touch them.</p>

<p>Step outside Workspace and you'll find yourself right in the middle of Gastown: one of the hippest, up-and-coming, tech and start-up neighborhoods in Vancouver. In one direction is <a href="http://communicopia.net">Communicopia's</a> office, in the other is <a href="http://www.bryght.com">Bryght's</a> (stop by Thursdays for their regular BBQ lunch), around the corner is <a href="http://nitobi.com">Nitobi</a>, and a few blocks away I can find <a href="http://thetyee.ca">the Tyee</a> and <a href="http://www.geist.com">Geist</a> too. It's hard to walk a block without running into people you know. (And, If you happen to run into Andre Charland of Nitiobi on a Friday afternoon, it's likely that he'll insist you visit his home-away-from-home in <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler</a> for a weekend of hiking, biking, and relaxing with adult beverages.)</p>

<p>One could get addicted to working the west-coast way in no time flat.</p>

<p><i>Next week: I'll be working from the <a href="http://webcollective.coop/">Web Collective</a> office in Seattle (located in the same building as <a href="http://www.onenw.org/">ONE/Northwest</a>, but I'll try to check out <a href="https://coworking.pbwiki.com/CoworkingSeattle">Seattle's co-working movement</a> too, with a visit to <a href="http://www.officenomads.com/">Office Nomads</a> and <a href="http://www.mydayoffice.com/">My Day Office</a>.</i></p>
