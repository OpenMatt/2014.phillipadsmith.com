After [peeking inside the Chicago Tribune's news apps team](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/05/a-peek-inside-the-tribapps-team-at-the-chicago-tribune.html) last week, I descended deep, deep into the Tribune's basement. Once home to printing presses, the lower levels of the Tribune tower were about to host a conversation about the future of news, courtesy of [Hacks/Hackers Chicago](http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/) and the [Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership](http://drumbeat.org/journalism).

Fueled only by pizza and sugary sodas, and a [mercilessly-short presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/phillipadsmith/mozilla-mojo-chicago-hackshackers-event), these brave hacks and hackers put pen to paper and [brainstormed how to improve news experiences on the open Web](http://meetupchicago.hackshackers.com/events/17845451/).

A mere thirty minutes later, they were asked to present those ideas back to the group. [Here they are](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL40DA257288700BE3):

I'm excited about what the MoJo team has been able to do via [these 'design jam' events](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Mojo/meetups) with the [Hacks/Hackers community](http://hackshackers.com/) and our [news partners](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/MoJo#The_news_partners). It's more than just getting the word out about the [innovation challenges](http://drumbeat.org/journalism): we're helping to build community and conversations around the field of news innovation that will have impact for years to come.

A big thanks is due to Trib staffers [Joe Germuska](http://twitter.com/JoeGermuska) and [Chris Groskopf](http://twitter.com/onyxfish), and Medill's [Rich Gordon](http://twitter.com/richgor) for organizing this event.
