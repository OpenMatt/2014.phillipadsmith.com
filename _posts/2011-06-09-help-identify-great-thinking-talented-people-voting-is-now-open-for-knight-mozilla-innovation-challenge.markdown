> Voting is now open

> Submissions for the 2011 challenge cycle are closed. Welcome to crowd evaluation. You can vote up your favorite ideas and leave comments. What do you like about these ideas? What would make them better?

> Your feedback, along with our review board, determines who advances to the next stage of the program.

In case you missed it in [yesterday's post](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/06/unlocking-video-beyond-comments-people-powered-news-lets-review.html), the public voting period for the Knight-Mozilla news innovation challenge [is underway](https://drumbeat.org/journalism/).

Voting ends June 16th. **That's just one week from today.**

To get started, all you need to do is:

1. Create an account on [drumbeat.org](https://drumbeat.org/) (it's fast, free, and easy)
2. Visit the challenge home page at [drumbeat.org/journalism](https://drumbeat.org/journalism/)
3. Choose a category of entries to read and vote on: [People powered news](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/open-webs-killer-app/), [Beyond comments](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/beyond-comment-threads/), or [Unlocking video](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/unlocking-video/).

You'll be presented with four random entries to review.

Dig-in and review a few.

All we're looking for at this stage is the seed of a good idea, or a demonstration of novel, new, or innovative thinking.

Like what you see? _Give it a thumbs up!_

It won't take you much time at all. And it's a big help.

Just think: you could help send a talented person to our learning lab -- putting them one step closer to an invitation to our 'hackfest' in Berlin, and possibly a year-long paid fellowship in [one of the world's top newsrooms](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/about/).

Do it for the kids.  :)
