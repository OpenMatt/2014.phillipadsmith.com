<p>This just came across my desk from the fine folks at The Tyee:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.thetyee.ca">The Tyee</a> has two workstations available in an overflow area of our newish office in Chinatown (211 East Georgia, right at the corner of Main).</p>
  
  <p>For a mere $250/month + HST, you get:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Desk, chair, bookshelf and lovely Ikea lamp (!)</li>
  <li>LAN and wireless connections</li>
  <li>Access card &amp; key for 24/7 use (space is alarmed)</li>
  <li>Use of shared meeting room (fits 8-10 comfortably)</li>
  <li>Use of kitchenette, water cooler, fridge</li>
  <li>Benefit of The Tyee’s wonderful company….</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Our office is funky, airy, with lots of natural light, in a great vibrant ‘hood.  Lots of good food around, good coffee (Bean Around the World and killer Vietnamese coffee too), close to Main St. Skytrain and Adanac bike path.  Some kind of bistro lounge is setting up right across the street too. </p>
  
  <p>Workstations are in a big open space, but we’re a pretty heads-down, hard-working crew.  Easy to get work done.  And then pop out once in a while for good conversations.  Arsenal Pulp Press recently moved in right next door to us, so it’s a wee publishing hub now.</p>
  
  <p>Give me a shout if you’re interested in taking a look.   If you’re sick of working from cafes and your living room, this might be just the thing.</p>
  
  <p>Cheers,
  Michelle</p>

<p>P.S. I'll be working from the Tyee's new office next week, so if you happen to be in the neighbourhood, please say "hello."</p>
