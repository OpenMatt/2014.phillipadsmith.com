title: Help fund the WiserEarth API
date: '2009-05-04 15:53:15 -0500'
excerpt: "<p>About two months ago, I was contacted by my colleague <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com/bios/leif.html\">Leif
  Utne</a>. He and Jon Warnow &#8211; both <a href=\"http://www.webofchange.com\">Web
  of Change</a> alumni &#8211; have started an experiment in crowd-sourced funding
  for an incredibly important technology project: <a href=\"http://wiserearth.org\">WiserEarth</a>.
  I signed on immediately. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#8217;s an e-mail from Leif about the
  project:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p><a href=\"http://wiserearth.org\">WiserEarth</a>
  is an amazing resource, a global index of over 110,000 NGOs (and growing). But it
  sorely needs an API so we can all develop apps to display and interact with that
  data through our own sites.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>That&#8217;s why Jon Warnow (of <a
  href=\"http://www.350.org\">350.org</a>), myself, and nearly 2 dozen other progressive
  technology and activist leaders have launched this effort to crowd-source the $10,000
  WiserEarth needs to finish developing their API. Just 1 day into this campaign we
  have $875 from 18 donors.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Can you or your organization make a
  donation today at <a href=\"http://openwiser.org\">http://openwiser.org</a>? Give
  whatever you can, even if it&#8217;s small. And spread the word.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>A
  WiserEarth API would benefit the entire progressive movement. Let&#8217;s help make
  it happen!</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>cheers,\r\n  Leif</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>p.s. Neither Jon
  or I work for WiserEarth. We&#8217;re just big fans who want to see the site succeed.
  And we believe a robust API is key to that success.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I
  hope you might take a moment to join me in <a href=\"http://openwiser.org/\">supporting
  the initiative</a>.</p>"
