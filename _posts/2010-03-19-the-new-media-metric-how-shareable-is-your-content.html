<div><br /></div>Light, but still interesting, <a href="http://industry.bnet.com/media/10007473/newest-metric-for-media-how-shareable-is-your-content/">article</a> that asks "<a href="http://industry.bnet.com/media/10007473/newest-metric-for-media-how-shareable-is-your-content/">How sharable is your content</a>?"<div><br /></div><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">Study after study indicates that Americans have developed all kinds of new habits when it comes to consuming the news. But one key upward trend that tends to get overlooked in the fine print of these studies is how popular content-sharing has become.</blockquote><br /><div>As more examples surface of how people are taking "ownership" of the news that they share, I'm reminded of a piece I read once called "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/magazine/05BUZZ.html">The Hidden (in Plain Sight) Persuaders</a>" about the company <a href="http://www.bzzagent.com/">BzzAgent</a>&nbsp;and how people just want to have something to say at parties.</div>
