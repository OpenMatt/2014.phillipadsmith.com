> _"Workflow and how that is coded into the CMS is a huge issue for newspapers." -- [Suw Charman-Anderson](http://charman-anderson.com/2011/05/18/linking-and-journalism-the-workflow-issue/)_

For the past few months, I've been hearing a consistent message from some folks working in so-called 'legacy' news organization: "our corporate content-management systems and our corporate culture are the main barrier to innovation."

But I'm starting to wonder if that fenced-in technical reality is leading to fenced-in thinking from those that are in the best position to push for change?

I've been around long enough to see some news organizations change their content-management system three or four times. You know what? _It didn't change the way they think about news at all._

From Atex to Movable Type, from NewsGate to Wordpress, from Interwoven to Bricolage: I've experienced them all over the last fifteen years. If there's anything consistent to any CMS, it's that **they all suck**. It's just a matter of which one sucks less in your specific situation.

IMHO, the problem isn't that _news_ is stuck in the wrong CMS, it's that _new thinking_ is stuck in something much harder to get out of: _the belief that change isn't possible (or already happening)._

Change _is_ happening, it's just not evenly distributed yet.  ;)

There are 'traditional' media organizations with wonderful, journalist-friendly enterprise content-management systems out there -- just have a look inside of MSNBC or Le Monde. Does it change their thinking dramatically? I'm not convinced.

Innovation can come from anywhere; you just have to be willing to look for it.
