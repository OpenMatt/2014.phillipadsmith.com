<p>This one slid off my desk last Friday, hoping that some of you in DC still have time to slip into this <a href="http://freepress.net/">FreePress</a>-sponsored event in DC tomorrow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope those of you in the D.C. area can join us next Tuesday night at the National Press Club for an event and discussion about the future of news.
  Free Press co-founders Robert W. McChesney and John Nichols will be talking about journalism in America today -- and how we can save it. They'll be joined by Jane Hamsher, founder and publisher of Firedoglake.com; Chris Hayes, Washington editor of The Nation; and Ivan Roman, executive director of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.</p>
