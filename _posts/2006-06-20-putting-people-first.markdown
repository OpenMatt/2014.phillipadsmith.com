<p>Several years ago, I was introduced to the organization that is now known as May First/People Link. I had just met Andrew Boyd and, at that time, he was fresh off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaires_for_Bush#Bush_.28Or_Gore.29_2000">Billionaires for Bush (or Gore) campaign</a>. The original Billionaires for Bush (or Gore) site had been developed with the assistance of Andrew&#8217;s good friend Will who was part of the May First Technology Collective (previously known as Media Jumpstart). Since that time, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to learn more about the work of this incredible organization, to read about its rich history, and to get to know  personally one of its founding member &#8212; Josue Guillen &#8212; at <a href="http://webofchange.org">Web of Change</a> in 2004. (And, if you&#8217;re in New York, you&#8217;ll probably run into Josue &#8212; as Melanie and I did &#8212; at a rally or march)</p>

<p>Media Jumpstart, the May First Technology Collective, and the newly formed <a href="http://mayfirst.org">May First/People Link</a> are part of an important movement to build people-based technology support for progressive organizations that is both radical and sustainable. Similar to my colleagues here in Toronto at the <a href="http://anarres.ca/">Anarres worker co-operative</a>, May First/People Link is focused on being a part of a movement for change &#8212; being involved with coalitions and taking positions on issues &#8212; in addition to supporting the technology needs of non-profits and grassroots groups. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever asked me &#8220;Where should I host my Web site,&#8221; you&#8217;ve probably heard me rant about the need for progressive organizations to take a closer look at their purchasing policies. I&#8217;m constantly surprised by organizations that work for change on one hand, and invest in multi-national corporations with the other. Why do so many non-profits bank with a credit union, or get their cards printed at a union printer, if their purchasing decisions don&#8217;t impact the issues that they&#8217;re working on? However, when it comes to Internet access, Web hosting, or technology support: most organizations are only too happy to hand over a $40 - $100/month investment to their local Telco or <a href="http://www.timewarner.com">corporate media giant</a>.</p>

<p>But, as <a href="www.lessig.org/blog">Lawrence Lessig</a> often asks: how many of you in this room invest $40 - $100 a month in the <a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a>, or other organizations that are working to protect people&#8217;s rights, or for people&#8217;s movements? </p>

<p>If we want to build a movement, we have to start walking the talk. This means shopping and buying locally (even if it&#8217;s Internet services), it means choosing organic (free and open source software, hello!?) where possible, and it means banking with those credit unions or going with a unionized printer when you can. So, when it comes to putting your organization online, that means looking to member-based &#8212; and values-aligned &#8212; organizations like May First/People Link (and double that if your organization is in New York or the US). You should choose a provider not only because they&#8217;ll treat you like a real customer (not just a customer number), but also because you&#8217;re investing in a movement, and in real people like <a href="http://mayfirst.org/bios">Josue</a> and his colleagues. </p>

<p>So, go check out the new <a href="http://mayfirst.org">May First/People Link website</a> and take a look at what the organization is about. And, if you are paying a commercial provider for your service,  think about whether it make sense to use that money to support a values-aligned organization (and get even better service in exchange). </p>
