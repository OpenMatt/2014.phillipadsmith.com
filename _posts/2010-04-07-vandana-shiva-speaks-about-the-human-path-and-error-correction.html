Dr.&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Shiva" title="Vandana Shiva" rel="wikipedia">Vandana Shiva</a> spoke to a packed room at <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_College_of_Art_%26_Design" title="Ontario College of Art &amp; Design" rel="wikipedia">OCAD</a> last night about the "Earth's design" (which is perfect, of course) and the human path. I took some short videos of her talk, and enjoyed her take on the financial crisis and various other "errors" that the human race has made along the way, and how the human race seem incapable of correcting for those errors in any meaningful way.<div><br /></div><div>Her book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soil-Not-Oil-Environmental-Justice/dp/0896087824">Soil Not Oil: Environmental Justice in an Age of Climate Crisis</a>" is on my reading list and should be on yours too.&nbsp;</div>
