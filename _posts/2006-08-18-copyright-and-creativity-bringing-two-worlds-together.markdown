Planning for the event really got under way in June, with the addition of several new team members, and has been racing forward at a break neck speed every since. With only six weeks to go until the event, we&#8217;re all anxious to get the word out and to get your <a href="http://copycamp.ca/how-you-can-contribute">ideas, suggestions, participant recommendations, and commitments to being there</a>. Here&#8217;s the key info:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Who</b> will be there: people are confirming their attendance every day and it&#8217;s turning out to be an incredible list of people working in the arts, new media and technology, activists, and scholars (and a few beaurucrats). Just a few of the names that I can remember (and am excited about) are: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativland">Mark Hosler from Negativland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Geist">Michael Geist</a>, and dub poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Allen">Lillian Allen</a>.</li>
<li><b>What</b> to expect: The event will merge together the best things from unconferences, Open Space facilitation, and several of the quirkier convening approaches that <a href="http://mglouberman.com/misha.html">Misha Glouberman</a> is known for. Expect small groups, hands-on skill shares, unusual formats, inspiring conversations, and something to write home about.</li>
<li><b>When</b> is the event? When is the Wiki going to be online? The event is at the end of September (28th - 30th) and the Wiki should be online in the next two weeks. In addition to the wiki, we&#8217;re going to try some pre-event guest blogging and interviews to get the conversation started early.</li>
<li><b>Where</b> is my royalty payment? Yes, indeed, where is it? No, seriously, this event is going to show you where it is &#8212; now, and in the years to come &#8212; it going to open that conversation up and hold a big magnifying glass in front of it. This event aims to explore the new models of creativity, creation, and compensation in the age of the Internet.</li>
<li><b>Why</b> is this conversation important? Frankly, I was skeptical at first. This is the land of holy wars: copyright vs. copyleft. But <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/journal/bios/screan.htm">Susan Crean</a> is 110% genuine in her commitment to bringing together a diverse group of creators &#8212; people working in a variety of mediums, at different stages in their careers, and from different backgrounds &#8212; to have an honest, <i>creator-to-creator</i>, conversation about what the future of cultural production and distribution looks like.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, as you can tell, this all has me very excited. After the (surprising) interest in the <a href="http://socialtechbrewing.org/node/10" title="Social Tech Brewing event on copyright">last copyright/copyleft event that I volunteered to organize earlier this year</a>, I can only imagine what a serious event like this &mdash; with some resources and a bit more time &mdash; might achieve.</p>

<p>CopyCamp will take its cue from other unconferences, like <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">FooCamp</a> and <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>, and will add in a few elements of traditional (and less traditional) convening. It will be an intentionally hybrid event. And I expect that it will weave together some of Dave Pollard&#8217;s insight into &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2006/05/02.html">how to unconference</a>&#8221; with the quirky magic of events like <a href="http://www.trampolinehall.net">Trampoline Hall</a>. Many aspects of the event&#8217;s format is being developed by veteran host Misha Glouberman, so it&#8217;s sure to be fun, chaotic, and to flip the expected on its head (in fact, <a href="http://copycamp.ca/how-you-can-contribute">I&#8217;ve already heard reference</a> to a &#8220;Twenty Ideas You Didnâ€™t Know You Were Interested in&#8221; session).</p>

<p>I was speaking with Misha last Tuesday and, over the next couple of weeks, we&#8217;re going to try to get the entire schedule into the Wiki &mdash; in a form where participants can have some impact on the actual logistics of the sessions (e.g.,: &#8220;Hey! How can you have session X at the same time as session Y? I really want to got to both&#8230; so I&#8217;m just going to move things around a bit&#8221;). All I can say is it&#8217;s going to be the most interesting event about copyright, and being a creator in the zero-decade, that I&#8217;ve ever been to. And, if you&#8217;re in Toronto &#8212; or able to make it here &#8212; I hope you can be there too.</p>
