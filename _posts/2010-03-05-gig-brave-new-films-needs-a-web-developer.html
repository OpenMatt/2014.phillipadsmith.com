<p>Another great opportunity. This time with <a class="zem_slink" href="http://bravenewfilms.org/" title="Brave New Films" rel="homepage">Brave New Films</a>, a pioneer in socially progressive documentaries and viral videos that was founded by filmmaker <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greenwald" title="Robert Greenwald" rel="wikipedia">Robert Greenwald</a>. Quick summary of the position is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wanted: a full-time Web Developer for Brave New Films (location: Anywhere, USA) to guide and implement our online tech efforts. Build HTML websites with light PHP code. Be on top of developments in social media and technologies to guide and inform our distribution strategy. We care less about writing perfect code and more about executing the clever idea that'll wreak havoc on the establishment. More info and apply at: <a href="http://bit.ly/djya2Y">http://bit.ly/djya2Y</a></p>
  
  <p>Politics moves fast. We have some pretty intense deadlines, so we're pragmatic. Think startup meets non-profit political rabble rousers. We also get along well with people that have an excellent work ethic, juggle multiple tasks under tight deadlines, and realize this is not a 9-5 job. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like a great opportunity to work with an innovative organization working for social change. Apply <a href="http://bit.ly/djya2Y">here</a>.</p>
