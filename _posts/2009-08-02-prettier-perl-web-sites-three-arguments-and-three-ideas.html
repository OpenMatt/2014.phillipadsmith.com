<p> In doing a bit of background reading for this post, I stumbled on Sebastian Riedel's Perl Monk post from 2008 titled "<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=721101">Prettier Perl websites</a>." The discussion on that post is a fun read, as it highlights the polarization in the Perl community around Perl's (rather lousy) public image. <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=721605">This comment</a> says it all:
</p> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>
		One thing I always liked to say about Perl-based services/sites, is that they, like Perl (and the Camel) are "Ugly, but efficient".
	</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>
	However, if you're following the conversations about "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=Modern+Perl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Modern Perl</a>," and "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=Enlightened+Perl&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Enlightened Perl</a>," then you know that Perl doesn't have to be ugly to be efficient. And, in that spirit, I'm not going to debate the&nbsp;<em>why</em>, or <em>if</em>, improving the public face of Perl Web sites is important, as that has been covered in my <a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/07/26/is-the-perl-community-schizophrenic/">previous</a> <a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/07/28/perceptions-of-perl/">posts</a>. </p> 
  <h3>Three arguments</h3> 
  <p>
	So here are three arguments in favour of some greater consistency and some best practices when it comes to the Perl community's public-facing Web properties: 
</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> 
      <p>
			Let's start with something like <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001735/">Perl Best Practices</a>. Why bother with documenting best practices? Well, for starters, coding best practices are generally understood to make programs easier to read, and understand; and that helps everyone. 
		</p> 
    </li> 
    <li> 
      <p>
			Then there is CPAN and <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/PETDANCE/Module-Starter-1.52/getting-started.html">Module::Starter</a>. CPAN is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art">prior art</a>. The Perl community often encourages those new to the language to leverage the reusable components on CPAN, before re-inventing the wheel, and that makes a lot of sense. Same goes for Module::Starter. Creating things from scratch can be a pain-in-the-ass, and these examples of best practices make things a lot easier. 
		</p> 
    </li> 
    <li> 
      <p>
			Finally, there are tools like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/">PerlCritic</a> and <a href="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/">PerlTidy</a> that make it easier to follow good coding style and implement many of the best practices automatically. 
		</p> 
    </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>
	Contrary to popular belief, <strong>guidelines don't have to be a constraint</strong>. Used effectively, they benefit the entire Perl community. 
</p> 
  <h3>Three ideas</h3> 
  <p>
	So, what would be some equivalent initiatives that could serve to introduce best practices, prior art, and tools for making "Prettier Perl Web sites?" Here are three ideas: 
</p> 
  <p> <strong>Perl community graphic standards</strong>: A good start would include some tools to support those developing new projects, like <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre</a>, when they reach the point of needing a graphic identity and a public-facing -- aka <em>marketing</em> -- Web site. 
</p> 
  <p>
	Like any <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/tools/guidelines_and_standards_manuals.htm">graphic standards guide</a>, it could include examples of how to take existing Perl-community-developed material and customize it for a new project (while keeping things consistent). Editable logo files, suggested colour palettes, and example Web site layouts could all be included here. 
</p> 
  <p><strong>Perl community editorial style guide</strong>: A fair amount of the whole <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/perlceptions">Perceptions of Perl</a> conversation has focused on how the Perl community <em>talks</em> about Perl. Just like Perl Best Practices, establishing consistent ways of communicating about Perl publicly -- at conferences, in the boardroom, and on Perl community Web sites -- would benefit everyone. 
</p> 
  <p>
	And maybe this wouldn't even take that much effort, as I would guess that O'Reilly already has an <a href="http://oreilly.com/oreilly/author/stylesheet.html">editorial style guide</a> for their Perl-related books. That could be a starting point toward more consistency in how we write (spellings, capitalizations, etc.) and talk (editorial voice, etc.) about Perl. </p> 
  <p> <strong>Perl blogger themes</strong>: A quick scan of the blogs involved in the <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Iron Man Blogging Challenge</a> reveals <a href="http://www.asciiville.com/">that</a> <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/">many</a> <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/leonard/perl/">Perl</a> <a href="http://blog.bjornoya.be/lab_stacks/">bloggers</a> are using a default, out-of-the-box, "theme" (layout and styles) for their blog. Additionally, Perl bloggers seem to favour the Perl-based Movable Type blogging platform. (Though a suprising number also use the PHP-based Wordpress too.) This presents an opportunity to say "<em>Hey there Perl blogger, why not use this nifty, Perl-specific, Movable Type theme?</em>" (Obviously, the theme could be ported to any system.)
</p> 
  <p>
	What would the theme include? How about built-in links, using consistent language, to the Perl community's main properties, automatic syndication of key Perl newsfeeds, and -- most importantly -- a blog design that would make any blog author proud.
</p> 
  <p>
	This marks the end of my rant about Perceptions of Perl and Prettier Perl Web sites (hopefully!). Next up: less rant and more practical examples of how we can make things better. As Sebastian said "<em>Don't explain what you think would look better, just make a mockup and show us!</em>"
