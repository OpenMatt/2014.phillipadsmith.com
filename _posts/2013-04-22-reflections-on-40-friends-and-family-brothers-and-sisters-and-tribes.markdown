It seems fitting that as a sit down to write this reflection, two days before I turn forty, that I'm bundled up at a friend's apartment in Vancouver struggling to fight off a cold. 

I am away from my bio-family, who are mostly in Toronto, but I don't feel alone at all. Quite the opposite: I feel embraced and supported by an extended family just about everywhere I go, be it Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, London, Brighton, Berlin, Adelaide, or Oaxaca. This other family is my [tribe](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-14-01-in-my-tribe.html), a term I adopted from a great article in the New York Times more than ten years ago, and a term that fit more than ever with my lifestyle and beliefs.

I live with very few regrets in life, and I get that confident perspective from my mother. My mother is an inspiration: she has a been a race-car driver, fought her way into a men-only business club before that was a thing to do, succeeded as an entrepreneur more than once, excelled as a corporate executive, and completed a marathon just a year after a major health setback. There is only _one_ regret that I've heard her mention with any frequency and that is that she didn't provide me with a sibling.

But my life is rich with siblings. I feel like I have an abundance of brothers and sisters; people I can play with, grow with, dance with, and share my inner-most thoughts with. It is the strength of those relationships that gives me the confidence to follow my dreams.

Nonetheless, I realize that I must strive to not take these relationships for granted, because I suspect that it is all too easy to let these friendships slip away in the hustle-and-bustle of lives now full with careers, marriages, children, homes, and so on. I am certain that truly great friendships are _built_. It's rare that one has been simply handed to me on a silver platter. Neglected, without a doubt, they will start to fade.

This past weekend I read a profoundly simple recipe called [My Code of Friendship](http://getlifeboat.com/friend-blog/my-code-of-friendship/), written as part of a project called [Lifeboat](http://getlifeboat.com/) that was, serendipitously enough, produced by people I know through [Web of Change](http://webofchange.com/). Web of Change was a spark that changed the direction of my life, and also ignited many great and lasting friendships that I still have to this day. So it should have been no surprise to me that people from that network would have created "[a movement of people rediscovering great friendships](http://getlifeboat.com/about/)."

I realize now, reflecting on the ideas behind the Lifeboat project, that having a brothers and sisters, an extended family, a tribe, is not an accident.

Going forward, I want to strive to:

+ Continue to work on building truly great friendships: both old and new
+ Explore with friends how I can help them to feel at ease: there should be no pressure or guilt in great friendships
+ And to always remember that -- if I'm typing a message into a tiny box on a screen to feel connected -- I should probably just pick up the phone.

Finally, I would add to the code: _take a long view_. Part of what makes it possible for me to embrace "[slow](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/tags/slow)" is the confidence that the world is going to be here for a long, long time. Projects like the [Clock of the Long Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now) are a great reminder that friendships can be like that too: they can exhibit longevity and evolvability, as long as you give them the room to do so.
