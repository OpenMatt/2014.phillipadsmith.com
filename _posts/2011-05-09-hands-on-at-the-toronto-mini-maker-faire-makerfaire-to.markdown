Sunday was a _glorious_ day here in Toronto. And what better to do on a glorious day than ride your bike down to Toronto's first [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairetoronto.ca/).

> "Toronto Mini Maker Faire is the ultimate celebration of making, crafting, DIY-ing, tinkering, hacking and sharing. It's a weekend where makers of all kinds will show off their projects and hold how-to workshops, with hands-on activities for all ages. Exhibits on display will include robots, laser cutting, letterpress printing, a 3D print gallery and kinetic sculptures." -- Toronto Mini Maker Faire Web site

With more than [seventy 'makers' demonstrating their work or wares](http://makerfairetoronto.ca/makers/) at the event -- including several makers of the gastronomic kind -- it was a feast for the senses.

If you missed it, here's a quick, 180 second, peek into the Toronto Mini Maker Faire:

I'm almost embarrassed to mention that this was my first trip to the [Evergreen Brick Works](http://ebw.evergreen.ca/), one of the most interesting and lively re-developed areas in Toronto. If you haven't been yet, you should definitely check it out on a weekend.

Over and out for today.
