<p>You <a href="http://twobullsinachinashop.com/2010/02/what-do-paraguay-canada-and-yogurt-have-in-common.shtml">learn something new</a> every day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The ancestors of these Mennonites lived in West Prussia until the end of the 18th century, in the Black Sea region of the Ukraine until 1874 and in Manitoba, Canada, until 1926, before settling in Paraguay.  Why did they leave Canada, you ask?  Who would EVER leave Canada?  It was a reaction to the introduction of universal, secular compulsory education in 1917 requiring the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community.
