<p>This just in from <a href="http://communicopia.net/">Jason Mogus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UNICEF has one of the most recognized brands in the world, and their Canadian arm is poised to break new ground as they re-invent themselves to be a more nimble, responsive and digitally driven 21st Century org. I am helping them hire a new Director of Digital Strategy, an exciting new senior position to create a new cross functional team, online fundraising program - and an entire new way of working internally - from scratch. This is an amazing opportunity for an entrepreneurial leader with deep digital skills and management aspirations to grow something remarkable from the ground up. </p>

<p>Looks like an <a href="http://bit.ly/7PnGIu">incredible opportunity</a>. </p>
