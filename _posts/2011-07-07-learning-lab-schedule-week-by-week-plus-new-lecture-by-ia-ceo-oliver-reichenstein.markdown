First the great news, then the good news. (FYI: There is no bad news in MoJo-ville.)

I'm excited to let you know that we've confirmed that Oliver Reichenstein, CEO of [iA Inc](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/), will deliver a lecture for the lab in July.

For those who are not familiar with iA (Information Architects, Inc.), let me just say this: very few organizations have had as much impact when it comes to modern-day information design. Not only is iA "one of the best-known design agencies in the world," but it is also an organization that is not afraid to take some risks by developing its own products -- from the ubiquitous [iA³ Template for WordPress](http://store.informationarchitects.jp/product/ia³-template), to ultra-minimalist writing software [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) for the Mac and iPad.

I should also note that iA worked with our news parter [Zeit Online](http://www.zeit.de/) to produce the innovative HTML5, tablet-friendly, version of zeit.de -- if you have a tablet (or know how to change your User Agent settings), you should take a moment to [check it out](http://www.zeit.de).

Welcome aboard, Oliver.
