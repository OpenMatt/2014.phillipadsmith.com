    <p>Activist organizations are getting bitten by storing their data in &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">the cloud</a>&quot; and there is a lot that can be done about it. &nbsp;Over the years, I've seen this happen, more than a few times, to organizations that I've worked with. Heck, it's happened twice in the last year just to <em>New Internationalist</em>. But the question is: as Web services used by these organizations shut-down, or -- worse -- when they willingly hand out data to any repressive regime that asks for it, are there enough alternatives being developed to provide, well, alternatives?&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>This concern was brought back to life for me recently with the news that the micro-blogging service <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/6/twitter_crackdown_nyc_activist_arrested_for">Twitter allegedly assisted authorities in locating an activist during the G-20 Protest in Pittsburgh</a>, resulting in his arrest.. The possible collusion of services like Twitter is a relatively new activist security concern, historically concerns focused on the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=indymedia+server+seizure">all-too-frequent seizure of Internet servers and hardware</a> used by activists and organizations like Indymedia. But now that people's data is moving &quot;into the cloud,&quot; there are a lot more issues to be concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
