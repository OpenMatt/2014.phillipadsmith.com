<p>It's totally inspiring to see someone like <a href="http://www.publicus.net/">Steven Clift</a> -- a person dedicated and passionate about the possibility of more accessible global democracies -- <a href="http://dowire.org/notes/?p=310">be recognized</a> by an organization like <a href="http://askoka.org">Ashoka</a>. He writes:</p>

<p>Stephen has been a driving force by many of the most interesting an ambitious initiatives at documenting global movements toward "e-democracy," including compiling one of the most complete records (that I've found) of <a href="http://dowire.org/wiki/Canada_elections">Canadian federal election resources</a>. (And, for added points, it's a Wiki: so, if there's something not listed there -- go add it now!)</p>

<p>Finally, if you haven't heard the story of Ashoka -- you should take the time to find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Change-World-Social-Entrepreneurs/dp/0195138058">David Bornstein's book</a> about their activities and how they're aiming to change the world by supporting social entrepreneurs. Several of their fellows <a href="http://www.ashoka.ca/fellows/can_fellows.cfm?q=us-canada/fellows/can_fellows.cfm">live and work right here in Canada</a> and are working on projects that you should know about.</p>
