excerpt: "                        \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n
  \                               <img src=\"http://www.phillipadsmith.com/files/picture_10.png\"
  />\r\n                            \r\n<i>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2009/07/a-new-twitter-activism-tool.shtml\">www.phillipadsmith.com</a></i>
  \      \r\n\r\n                I'm about a month late on this, but I still think
  it's more than worthy of a quick post. Jim Gilliam worked with Jesse Haff from Brave
  New Films to create an impressive new tool for online activism called <a href=\"http://act.ly/\">act.ly</a>.
  \r\n\r\n<br /><br />As you might note from the cute Web address, act.ly is kind
  of a mashup of a URL-shortening service with Twitter integration, but the beauty
  is in its reinvention of the traditional (aka boring) online petition. \r\n\r\n<br
  /><br />Have a cause to promote online? Why not try act.ly and see if your targets
  have their heads around social media yet. Kudos to Jim, Jesse, and the act.ly team
  for innovating online activism."
