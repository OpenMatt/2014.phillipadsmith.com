<p>
	Called the Social Innovators Summit, the event&#8217;s intention was to &#8220;&#8230;seed, support and advance social entrepreneurship.&#8221; Our hosts for Thursday night's kickoff dinner were Lee Davis, Co-Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.nesst.org">Nonprofit Enterprise and Self-sustainability Team</a> (an international nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting social enterprise in emerging market countries), and Michael Shuman, Vice President for Enterprise Development for the Training &amp; Development Corporation, and author of books including <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=1576753867">The Small-Mart Revolution: How Local Businesses Are Beating the Global Competition</a>. The next day all 70 participants were exposed to new ideas, got to workshop emerging initiatives, and to discuss innovative solutions to our collective challenges.
</p>
<p>
	So, without further adieu, I will just jump right in and summarize the &#8220;<a href="http://wiki.advocacydev.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SpeedGeeking">speed geek</a>&#8221; presentations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<a href="http://communityenvironment.org/site_contents/shareit.htm">Share-IT</a>: presented a community program to address our growing problem of dealing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-waste">e-waste</a> that distributes recovered technology to individuals and organizations that can put the technology to good use. (Not exactly <a href="http://freegeek.org">FreeGeek</a>, but gett&#8217;n close.)

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.ulern.on.ca">uLern</a>: is a social-research incubator and accelerator (their tag-line is &#8220;Fueling research partnerships") that brings together research partners to push forward new thinking on everything from environmental toxins to biodegradable cars.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.vartana.org/">Vartana</a>: often called &#8220;the charity bank,&#8221; Vartana&#8217;s mission is to provide new financing mechanisms for Canada&#8217;s charities and non-profits, providing them with necessary financial mechanisms to explore earned-income and social enterprise opportunities.

			<a href="http://summerhillgroup.ca/home.html">Summerhill Group</a> a &#8220;market transformation company&#8221; &#8212; one of the many organizations in Canada looking at the role of market forces in social change &#8212; shared the story of local initiatives to work with retailers and consumers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the <a href="http://www.cleanairfoundation.org/mowdownpollution/">Mow Down Pollution</a> and <a href="http://www.cleanairfoundation.org/keepcool/">Keep Cool</a> campaigns.

			One of my personal favourites, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phillipadsmith/174093727/in/set-72157594176172167/ &#8220;Mary-Lou explains Carrot Cache&#8221;">Mary-Lou Morgan</a> shared the history of Toronto&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thebigcarrot.ca/">Big Carrot Natural Foods Market</a>, the <a href="http://www.carrotcommon.com/">Carrot Common Mall</a>, and then described their new(er) initiative called <a href="http://www.carrotcommon.com/history.html#carrotcache">Carrot Cache</a>, an organization that supports community food strategies and worker co-operatives with start-up stage funding. This is a <em>fantastic</em> example of a long-standing, successful, and sustainable business model that is making an effort to sow the necessary seeds for change in the future.

	After the speek geek sessions, we enjoyed a lunch provided by <a href="http://www.vertcatering.com">Vert Catering</a> (the whole event was &#8220;green,&#8221; with everything from <a href="http://www.darkcitycoffee.com/">Dark City coffee</a> to having its carbon offset by <a href="http://www.bullfrogpower.com">Bullfrog Power</a>) and listened to the story of <a href="http://www.sarvodaya.org/">Sarvodaya</a> &#8212; Sri Lankaâ€™s biggest charity. And, if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I had my mind blown by a post-lunch panel on new &#8220;social business models,&#8221; where Michel Labbe told the inside story of (they are so incredible you most go read about them) <a href="http://www.optionsforhomes.ca/">Options For Homes Nonprofit Corp.</a>, Keith Harding bluntly told us to stop wearing Birkenstocks and shared the powerful example of <a href="http://www.familyserviceseap.com/">Family Services Employee Assistance Programs</a> &#8212; a commercial operation owned and run by the non-profit Family Services Canada &#8212; and, finally, Sarah Knox demonstrated how &#8220;thinking small (real small!)&#8221; can be replicable and have broad community impacts with the example of the Kinder Garden Childcare Co-op. 
</p>
<p>
	I&#8217;m usually the first one to get <strike>angry</strike> a little annoyed when I hear people say &#8220;the solution to struggling non-profits is to run them like business&#8221; &#8212; which I personally feel is <em>not</em> the best suited (or only) approach to operating a sustainable social change organization &#8212; but am happy to report that the 4th annual Social Innovators Summit (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/sis2006/">more photos here</a>) left me inspired and with lots to think about. Hearing about these new models &#8212; and being in the room with many of the social-mission organizations that I&#8217;m already happy to be using, e.g., <a href="http://turnaroundcouriers.com/">Turn-around Couriers</a> and the <a href="http://www.workingskillscentre.com/">Working Skills Centre</a> &#8212; leaves me with some hope for <a href="http://toronto.ca">this city</a> and our movement at large. 
</p>
<p>
	So, if you want to hear about the next event, <a href="http://socialinnovation.ca/">get on the innovators e-mail list</a> &#8212; or, if you were at the event and you&#8217;re reading this, please let me know if I&#8217;ve missed anything&#8230; or just leave a comment with a link and a description of what you&#8217;re up to!
