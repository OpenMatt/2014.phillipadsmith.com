Just cleaning out (my chronically inundated) Inbox and ran across this great, free, event for folks in or around Washington, DC by the wonderfully talented people at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neworganizing.com">New Organizing Institute</a>:

<blockquote>2008 exposed an entire generation of progressives to organizing for the first time. 

Many of us are already intimately familiar with the moving pieces of the progressive movement. But 2008's new recruits are still looking at its machinery from the outside. 

That's why NOI is holding a Progressive Movement Crash Course for these newcomers in Washington, DC -- it's an intensive, day-long introduction to the world of progressive organizing -- labor, advocacy, non-profits, philanthropy, and more! 

I'm sure you know at least one talented organizer who could use a thorough introduction to the progressive community. 

Can you forward this email to your friends about attending the Progressive Movement Crash Course on Thursday, February 26th?
