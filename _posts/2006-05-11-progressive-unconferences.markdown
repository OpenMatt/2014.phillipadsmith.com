excerpt: <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking quite a bit about the whole unconference movement
  that has been exploding across North America and is landing hard in Toronto this
  weekend, with back-to-back events, including <a href="http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampToronto">DrupalCampToronto</a>,
  <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampTdot">BarCampTdot</a>, and the <a href="http://meshconference.com">Mesh
  Conference</a> (which is really more of a traditional conference, but provides a
  nice book-end for the other two).

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking quite a bit about the whole unconference movement that has been exploding across North America and is landing hard in Toronto this weekend, with back-to-back events, including <a href="http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampToronto">DrupalCampToronto</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampTdot">BarCampTdot</a>, and the <a href="http://meshconference.com">Mesh Conference</a> (which is really more of a traditional conference, but provides a nice book-end for the other two). Specifically, I&#8217;ve been wondering what it would take to catalyze a movement of similar events that focused on building the capacity &#8212; and links between &#8212; progressive non-profits across Canada? Perhaps something similar to the non-profit technology events known as <a href="http://penguinday.org">Penguin Day</a>.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://davidcrow.ca">David Crow</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.workshopforgood.org/">Workshop for Good</a> &#8212; a software training weekend that will donate its proceeds to a local charity &#8212; it really got my neurons working. Okay: so donating all of your proceed to a local organization is <em>really</em> cool&#8230; but it would be even cooler if those local organizations could come together to explore the systemic challenges that they&#8217;re facing in an environment that was fast, dynamic, participant-focused, and instantly recorded.</p>

<p>Although many people would say that this current movement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconferences</a> is drawing on the rich history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a> for convening, I personally feel that the characteristics of BarCamp-like events are quite different. Here are a few of the differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Self-organizing</strong>: basically, these events are somewhat contagious and spontaneous and tend to come together quite organically. The Open Space events that I&#8217;ve attended usually exhibit a lot of logistics, planning, and organization before the actual event.</li>
<li><strong>Wiki-powered</strong>: replacing dead-trees with the modern-age digital notepad, these events are largely organized and recorded in real time. This is possible thanks to the popularity of modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wiki software</a>, software that makes it possible for organizers and participants to collaborate on a group of Web pages that detail all of the logistical needs and learning objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Unorganizers</strong>: largely, the spirit of these events is altruism and voluntary cooperation (just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> would have wanted). The events are participant focused and the organizer(s) tend to fade into the background. These events usually involve a lot of donated energy and a small amount of financial sponsorship to make the convergence possible. So, all-in-all, it&#8217;s quite ad-hoc and the model is <em>very</em> contagious. (David has a nice post on the unconference "revolution" <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1074/you-say-you-want-a-revolution">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what does all this mean? Well, what would happen if we applied this model to organizations working in the public interest? To social-service agencies or national advocacy networks? What would a progressive unconference look like for these communities? I had a couple of ideas off the bat: like <b>GreenCamp</b>, <b>JusticeCamp</b>, and <b>DemocracyCamp</b>&#8230; however, it was in discussing the idea with my partner Melanie that I realized the implications of extending this into the &#8220;less sexy&#8221; areas of our progressive movement; areas like disability, health care, and racism. Could a grassroots movement of spontaneous and easy-to-organize events be seeded and evolve the BarCamp idea to include things like <b>HealthCareCamp</b>, <b><strike>DisabilityCamp</strike> AbilityCamp</b>, and <b>RaceCamp</b>? I think it&#8217;s a novel idea: why don&#8217;t you tell me what you think? </p>
