<p>Well, as a somewhat half-baked attempt to get something more recent into the "Announcements" section of this blog, I'm going to give provide a run-down of the last couple months here at Community Bandwidth, and then present a snapshot of what's to come in 2007.</p>

<p><!--break-->
September and October were back-to-back excitement and travel, as I managed to squeeze in five major events into a two week period, including <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/news/2006/07/an_event_apart_seattle_2006_schedule.php">An Event Apart</a> in Seattle, then up to <a href="http://hollyhock.ca">Hollyhock</a> to help convene the annual <a href="http://webofchange.org">Web of Change</a> gathering. While there, I had the opportunity to <a href="http://www.webofchange.com/progressive-online-media-lets-talk">host an incredible conversation on the realities of being a progressive online publisher</a> (which I recorded for your listening pleasure). Next up was a powerful gathering of some of Canada's most innovative independent online media organizations -- including <a href="http://thetyee.ca">The Tyee</a> and <a href="http://rabble.ca">rabble.ca</a> -- to discuss the possibility of building a "media consortium" similar to <a href="http://themediaconsortium.org">the one that's formed in the U.S.</a> Last but not least, <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/non-profit-collaboration-tools">a short session on non-profit collaboration</a> for the <a href="http://sustain.web.ca">Sustainability Network</a> and then head-first into three-days of <a href="http://copycamp.ca">Canada's most important copyright and creativity event to date</a>. Can you say <em>intense!?</em> Phew.</p>

<p>Okay, so what's on deck for 2007? Well, after some serious thought about my ability to actually meet these commitments, here goes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Brown Bag IT:</strong> Finally, I'm going to launch the free lunch-and-learn sessions on non-profit technology issues that I've been planning to do for the last year now. Sign-up for e-mail updates to get the first announcement.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking of e-mail announcements:</strong> have you noticed that you haven't received any lately? Yah, well, that's going to change too.</li>
<li><strong>Technology advice for <i>Canadian</i> non-profits:</strong> Tired of all the great advice for services that you can't sign-up for? Or about problems that you're not facing? Welcome to the reality of living north of a sector ten times larger that ours. So, just for Canadians: a series of articles on ground-level technology issues that are based on research of Canadian organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>What else might you see in 2007? More convening of important conversation, more resources that you can put to use right away, more fun-filled blog posts (and more regularly too) and -- of course -- less talk more rock. You heard it here first!</p>
