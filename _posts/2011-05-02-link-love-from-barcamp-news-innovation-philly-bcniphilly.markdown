Before I hit the road back to Toronto today, I wanted to share a little link love from [BarCamp News Innovation Philly](http://bcniphilly.com).

The event drew more than 100 people from around Philadelphia, and as far away as Washington, DC, New York, and [Sacramento, California](http://www.sacramentopress.com). There were roughly [25 sessions](http://bcni.splatcamp.com/events/12/event_dates/13) with a keynote by [Zach Seward](http://twitter.com/zseward), Outreach Editor for the Wall Street Journal. There's a good summary of the event on [Philly.com](http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-01/news/29493488_1_social-media-civic-engagement-bloggers).

Here are some resources from the event:

* Early in the morning, [Bas Slabbers](http://www.basslabbers.com/) introduced me to the [Eye-Fi mobile memory cards](http://www.eye.fi/) for direct uploading from digital cameras, and the [Foto Moto](http://www.fotomoto.com/) service for selling, and right-management for, photos online. Both are great tips for freelance photographers.

* That was followed by an impressively hands-on session with [Snorre Wik](http://www.youtube.com/vidiot9000) of Al Jazeera English, where Snorre shared inside tips for shooting video with digital SLRs, fast lighting set-ups, and "on the go" audio recording techniques. You can see these techniques in action in [Dying Inside: Elderly in prison](http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/faultlines/2010/06/20106383722130548.html). I'm curious to know if video journalists like Snorre are thinking about [the future of news video, and cinema, as it collides with the Web](http://drumbeat.org/journalism)?

* [Daniel "The Real-time Note Taker" Bachhuber](twitter.com/danielbachhuber) posted notes on three sessions (almost before they finished) that I didn't manage to get to: [Creating thriving communities where your readers are happy](http://danielbachhuber.com/2011/04/30/bcni-philly-creating-thriving-communities-where-your-readers-are-happy/), [Advanced WordPress development](), and Greg Linch's idea for a [Github for news](http://danielbachhuber.com/2011/04/30/bcni-philly-github-for-news/).

* I took some time to dig through the impressive [Open Data Philly](http://opendataphilly.org/) project _(Yo! Toronto! Let's get our act together)_, and I found some time to interview [Carl Leiby](http://www.carlism.org/) about his free and open source [Unscheduler](http://unscheduler.com/) software for BarCamp-style events.

* Last but not least, Ben from [Sacramento Press](http://www.sacramentopress.com) discovered (on Sky Mall, no less) the "[Dual Video Recorder](http://www.skymall.com/shopping/detail.htm?pid=203676935&c=)" that is -- no doubt -- going to set the world of news on fire.

Many thanks to [Sean Blanda](http://seanblanda.com/blog/) and the other folks at [Technically Philly](http://technicallyphilly.com/) and [Temple University](http://sct.temple.edu/web/journalism/) for organizing a great event. Other cities that want to explore 'news innovation' should look at this event as a template for what to do.

As soon as I'm back at my desk, I'll post a little video summary of the event. Stay tuned.
