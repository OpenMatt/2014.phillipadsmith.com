  News Flash: Global Warming Is a Myth!</p>\n  \n  <p>At least that's what residents
  of hurricane-ravaged Mississippi were told > when a local newscaster aired a fake
  news segment earlier this year. One > problem: the anchor at WTOK didn't tell viewers
  that the segment was\n  bought and paid for by ExxonMobil.</p>\n  \n  <p>The problem
  doesn't end in Mississippi. Free Press and the Center for\n  Media and Democracy
  today released a second groundbreaking report\n  that exposes more corporations
  placing propaganda as news on \n  television stations across the country .</p>\n
  \ \n  <p>This deception is illegal under federal rules and must be stopped.</p>\n
  \ \n  <p><a href=\"http://action.freepress.net/campaign/fakenews2/8engi5i49jbdkkt?\">Tell
  the FCC to Crack Down on Fake News</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In one of the <a
