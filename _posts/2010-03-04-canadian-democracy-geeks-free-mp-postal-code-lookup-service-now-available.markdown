title: 'Canadian Democracy Geeks: Free MP Postal Code Lookup service now available'
date: '2010-03-04 18:29:34 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Exciting to (finally) see a <a href=\"http://howdtheyvote.ca/news.php?i=free-postal-code-lookup-service\">freely
  available Web service for looking up Member of Parliament in Canada based on a postal
  code</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the various licensing costs and restrictions
  on the data required to support this service made it hard to provide as a \"free
  as in free beer\" service to organizations that wanted to make use of the data in
  advocacy applications and so on. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems those barriers have been
  lowered, as <a href=\"http://www.canoe42.ca/\">Cory Horner</a> from the <a href=\"http://howdtheyvote.ca\">How'd
  They Vote</a> team announces the service and speaks to the licensing questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n
  \ <p>I am pleased to present, at long last, a Postal Code to Member of Parliament
  web service: </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p><a href=\"http://howdtheyvote.ca/news.php?i=free-postal-code-lookup-service\">http://howdtheyvote.ca/news.php?i=free-postal-code-lookup-service</a></p>\r\n
  \ \r\n  <p>Sadly the raw data cannot be shared, but fortunately the terms of the
  licence dictate that its use in a web service is permitted.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a
  href=\"http://www.flora.ca/russell/\">Russell McOrmond</a>, <a href=\"http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/civic-data-wants-to-be-free\">a
  pioneer in this area</a>, pressed Cory about lookups based on geolocation, i.e.,
  enabling an end-user to click on a map and receive information on their Member of
  Parliament (made difficult by the nature of riding boundaries). And it appears that
  Cory has added that functionality to the API also, so that latitude and longitude
  can be used instead of postal code in the API query. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geeky among
  you might want to also know that the service using <a href=\"http://postgis.refractions.net/\">PostGIS</a>
  as the spatial database.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exciting times in Canada, as geeks start
  to put the Web services in place to enable more democracy-enabling technology. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Thanks
  to <a href=\"http://civicaccess.ca/\">Civic Access</a> for the info.)</p>"
