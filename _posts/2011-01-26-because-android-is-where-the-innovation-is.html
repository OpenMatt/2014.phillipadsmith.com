<p>I've always been enthusiastic about the promise of the "smart phone." Back in 2004, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_650">Treo 650</a> -- the phone of choice for creative multimedia types. At that time, the promised "smartness" fell considerably short of my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I've been on a journey ever since: from Blackberry, to iPhone, and Android. In fact, I have one of each sitting on my desk right now. "Which one?" you ask, makes it into my pocket each day? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Why? Because Android is where the innovation is.</p>
<p>So, who cares? Another Android vs. iPhone vs. Blackberry opinion? On the surface, probably. However, I feel that underlying this decision is a story of something more worthy of investigation: how innovation often happens in the shadow of something else.</p>
<p>In this case, that something else is Apple's <a class="zem_slink rdfa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_%28Apple%29" title="IOS (Apple)" rel="ctag:means wikipedia nofollow">iOS</a> platform. Apple established the user interface patterns, the "App Store" experience, and so on. But then something interesting happened: Apple slowed down. They changed the market, and then they slowed down. They opted to focus on consistency of experience over innovation -- fewer surprises and a front-facing camera vs. anything <i>really</i> <b>new</b>. Somewhere along that path, Android overtook iOS as the most innovative mobile operating system.</p>
<p>I'm musing out load here -- and this is entirely personal opinion -- but I should probably qualify "innovative" a bit. I offer the following as very, very short list of examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FM Tuner App</b>: Android hackers route around Google's complacency and enable FM radio reception capabilities on the Nexus One. These capabilities use the phone's bluetooth radio and a pair of headphones to enhance the reception. <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2010/07/13/nexus-one-finally-receives-fm-radio-support-not-thanks-to-google-but-the-android-community-coming-to-a-rom-near-you/">More info.</a></li>

  <li><b>Android meets</b> <a class="zem_slink rdfa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" title="Arduino" rel="ctag:means wikipedia nofollow"><b>Arduino</b></a> <b>(Amarino)</b>: "Amarino is a toolkit to connect Android-driven mobile devices with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino microcontrollers</a> via Bluetooth." Want to start the coffee maker from bed in the morning? It's all possible thanks to Android, Arduino, and Amarino.</li>

  <li><b>CouchDB on Android</b>: Probably the most interesting to me, having recently walked (well, er, crawled) down the road of developing a mobile application, is the potential for robust offline storage on mobile devices. <a href="http://www.couchone.com/">CouchDB</a> is making this possible by taking steps to <a href="http://www.couchone.com/android">port their database software to the Android platform</a>. Will it be on iOS one day? As CouchDB developers have stated publicly, "it's more of a political problem than a technical one" (to get Erlang running on iOS).</li>
</ul>
<p>(All of the above skip over some of the most obvious, user-facing, innovation that Android brought to the phone: integration with social services like Twitter, Facebook, and Gmail, where your contacts' information is augmented with social network data -- this is actually a great example where an open innovation made it to the market <i>first</i>.)</p>
<p>I suspect that there's also an older, more established, trend at work here: The cyclical nature of innovation. It's about ideas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panarchy">Panarchy</a> that embrace both periods of rapid innovation <em>and</em> periods of creative destruction. In established enterprises, there is often a yin and yang of focusing on new product development for a time, and then moving that product into a "monetization" phase where R&amp;D costs can be recovered. This is all expected, and probably as it should be.</p>
<p>But, and this is an important <em>but</em>: in the Android development community, <strong>the rapid innovation and creative destruction are happening simultaneously.</strong> This is a unique story. It's perhaps one of the better examples of the pragmatic benefits of "open" vs. closed, in terms of software development and the speed of innovation.</p>
<p>I was listening to <a class="zem_slink rdfa" href="http://scripting.com" title="Dave Winer" rel="ctag:means homepage nofollow">Dave Winer</a> as I was writing this, and he repeated the old idiom: "One foot on the train, and one foot on the platform." It resonated for me. With Android, I have both feet planted firmly on the train. The ride might get bumpy from time-to-time, but it's fast and exciting again and, most importantly, my phone is actually getting smarter.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: One day after writing this, Google published the upcoming <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html">Android 3.0 Platform Highlights</a> that reveal even more innovations that are on route to an Android device near you. The upcoming version is optimized to support devices with a "tablet" form factor.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE II</b>: A perfect storm this week, as Canalys declares Android "<a href="http://www.canalys.com/pr/2011/r2011013.html">the worldâ€™s leading smart phone platform</a>."</p>
