title: Do you have any video & audio podcasting platform recommendations?
date: '2010-08-13 19:36:38 -0500'
excerpt: |-
  <p>A friend wrote to me this week asking for a recommendation on "podcast platform software, he continues "I'm referring to software that will enable us to upload video and audio (a la Youtube) for others to view."</p>

  <p>Given that he already has a Web site, my sense is that he is looking for something quite separate and preferably hosted -- not a new Drupal/Workpress/Etc. site that needs to be built from scratch, I would guess -- that would make it possible to loosely integrate a podcast section to the existing site. </p>

  <p>I had a couple of suggestions from experience: for basic audio podcasts, I've used <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">BlogTalkRadio</a> and <a href="http://www.hipcast.com/">Hipcast</a>. I used Hipcast for a political campaign and it was easy to integrate into the campaign Web site, and -- more importantly -- it made it easy for the candidate to call in from anywhere to record a podcast. I see that Hipcast also handles video podcasts now, but haven't had an opportunity to try it out. </p>

  <p>I also wondered if something along the lines of a simple, hosted, blogging platform like <a href="http://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> might be an easy way to upload audio &amp; video and provide an RSS feed for it. From experience, I know that services like Posterous <a href="http://posterous.com/faq">handle audio and video quite nicely</a>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the fine folks over at <a href="http://rabble.ca">rabble.ca</a> pointed me to <a href="http://libsyn.com">Libsyn</a> some years ago -- I recall reading that it had some nice Web site integration features too.</p>

  <p>All that to say: <strong>What are your recommendations? What are you using to built a audio &amp; video podcast feed these days?</strong> Any and all link and experiences appreciated. </p>
