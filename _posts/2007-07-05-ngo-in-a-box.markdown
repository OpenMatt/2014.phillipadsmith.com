  <p>I saw a note from long-time friend <a href="http://velociraptor.info">Amanda Hickman</a> this week announcing the release of the <a href="http://base.ngoinabox.org/">"Base Edition of NGO-in-a-box"</a>. It reminded me of all the work that's been underway (for some years now) at <a href="http://tacticaltech.org/">Tactical Tech</a> to get the <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/">NGO-in-a-Box</a> project up-and-running. NGO-in-a-box is probably one of the most impressively organized projects in the social-technology sector ... from the <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/">NGO-in-a-Box</a> site:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>NGO-in-a-box offers a set of peer reviewed and selected Free and Open Source software (F/OSS), tailored to the needs of NGO's. It provides them not only with software, but also with implementation scenarios and relevant materials to support this.</p>

<p>Each "Edition" has Editorial teams that select the software, and write the documentation, and manage the project. To date they've released <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/?q=boxes/openpublishing">NGO-in-a-box Open Publishing Edition</a>, <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/?q=node/24">Security Edition</a>, <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/?q=boxes/audiovideo">Audio Video Edition</a>, and now the <a href="http://www.ngoinabox.org/?q=baserelease">Base Edition</a> that Amanda worked on.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://base.ngoinabox.org/">Base Edition</a> is a great resource if you're starting a new organization, or wondering how free and open-source software might be able to help your organization do more with less. The <a href="http://base.ngoinabox.org/">Base Edition</a> Web site describes it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...a collection of essential tools for running a small-to-medium sized NGO. You can use this toolkit to set up and coordinate your office, organize and manage projects, collaborate online and support your campaigns. The Box contains a set of peer-reviewed Free and Open Source Software tools, with associated guides and tutorials, giving you the technical foundations to build upon. </p>
