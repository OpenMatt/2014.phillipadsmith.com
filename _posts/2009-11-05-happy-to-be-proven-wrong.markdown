title: Happy to be proven wrong

excerpt: <p>I've had my attention pretty narrowly focused on finishing up a couple
  of projects for the last two weeks, which has meant being a little out of the loop
  (which is refreshing, actually). But it was nice to come up for air today and find
  this little note from a client waiting in my Inbox:</p>

<p>I've had my attention pretty narrowly focused on finishing up a couple of projects for the last two weeks, which has meant being a little out of the loop (which is refreshing, actually). But it was nice to come up for air today and find this little note from a client waiting in my Inbox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just wanted to write you a note to let you know the news about our weekly e-newsletter. We broke the 5000 recipients mark, and we have enough addresses to go to 8000! I remember you predicted that 5000 was the likely ceiling, so I just needed to gloat a bit, lol. And, of course, I want to share the award with you since you have been such a big part of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said in my response: I'm always happy to be proven wrong when the outcome is positive. (I wish all of the organizations I've worked with would work so hard to outperform my projections!)</p>

<p>That's it for today. More when I next come up for air.</p>
