Kinda' like the Big Bang, [Beautiful Trouble][bt] is quickly expanding to be a much larger universe. What was once a "book" project is now several books, a training network, and much more. Added to the big, beautiful family are two new projects: [Beautiful Rising][br] and [Beautiful Solutions][bs]. 
{: .lead}

It's been a while since I've written from a plane, train, or automobile, however I started drafting this post from the awkward side-to-side rocking of an oversized passenger van. This  ark on wheels was zooming north from Albany, New York up to the possibly snow-ensconced [Blue Mountain Center][bluemountain]. Travelling with me on this surprising journey were eight other veteran troublemakers.

Arriving at the Blue Mountain Center, we merged with a dozen more mischief-makers who have all become connected in one way or another with this "Beautiful Universe." It was sure to be an interesting experiment: 20+ activists, academics, trainers, writers, film makers, soon-to-be lawyers, and a couple of nerds thrown in for good measure -- all locked in a large wood cabin for several days of plotting the revolution (or, um, undertaking something possibly even more challenging -- strategic planning!).

This ever-expanding project, which started quite humbly as an effort to re-boot [The Activist Cookbook][cookbook], now has a relatively stable "staff" of eight, and growing roster of partnerships, including most recently [ActionAid Denmark][br] and Naomi Klein's [This Changes Everything][bs], as well as offshoots like [The Climate Ribbon](http://theclimateribbon.org/). The [book itself][bt] has sold more than 10,000 copies worldwide. We actually receive royalty checks from time to time.

Most recently, Beautiful Trouble has become a "real thing" -- no longer a project of [The Other 98%](http://other98.com), we've [officially incorporated as a non-profit in the state of New York](http://appext20.dos.ny.gov/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=4751574&p_corpid=4646906&p_entity_name=Beautiful%20Trouble&p_name_type=A&p_search_type=BEGINS&p_srch_results_page=0). It's first officers are [Andrew Boyd][ab], [David Oswald Mitchell][dom], and [yours truly][ps].

The various projects have a number of open calls for submissions and participation at the moment, including:

* [Case studies of creative Global South activism](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TwhtlmzFYhxAn63z34OQzAeV5rxYavc3H8AvbeWMZh8/viewform)
* [Submissions to the Beautiful Solutions lab](http://beautifultrouble.org/2014/08/07/beautiful-solutions-call-submissions/)
* [Suggestions of individuals for the Beautiful Rising advisory network](http://beautifulrising.org/news/#announcing-the-first-members-of-the-beautiful-rising-advisory-network)

And, if your organization is looking for the opportunity to learn creative tactics from a network of some of the best activist-trainers around, [we've got you covered there too](http://beautifultrouble.org/trainings/).

Arriving back from upstate New York, I had a sense of optimism for the world that I haven't experienced for quite a while. The people working on these projects are absolutely some of the most inspiring people I've ever met and had the opportunity to work with.

Will you create some [Beautiful Trouble][bt] with us?
