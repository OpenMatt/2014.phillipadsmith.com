title: Helping The Tyee fight Big Media Barons

excerpt: |-
  <p>It's been a fun week working with friends at <a href="http://thetyee.ca/">The Tyee</a>, <a href="http://www.birocreative.com/">Biro Creative</a>, and <a href="http://whatcounts.com">WhatCounts</a> to launch The Tyee's new <a href="http://joinus.thetyee.ca/">"media concentration" campaign</a>. Have to admit that it's been incredibly smooth and low stress; I think some of the folks at Biro even managed to get off to <a href="http://www.hollyhockleadership.org/social-change-institute-2007">Social Change Institute</a> at the same time. </p>

  <p>The focus of the campaign is to highlight the issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership#Canada:">media concentration in Canada</a> (Canada's media ecosystem severely lacks diversity), and to help The Tyee spawn some new subscribers in the process. </p>
