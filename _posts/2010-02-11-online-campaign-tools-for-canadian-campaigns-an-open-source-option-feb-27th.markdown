excerpt: "<p>This just in from our friend and online campaign workhorse <a href=\"http://eric.squair.ca\">Eric
  Squair</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>If you are running online campaigns
  in Canada, I want to <a href=\"http://connect-toronto.eventbrite.com/\">invite you
  to an event in Toronto later this month</a> to find out more about some open source
  tools for running campaigns in Canada.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Make Poverty History wants
  to share the free tools they have developed for Drupal, tools that make it quick
  and easy to set up online petitions, create online actions that put people in touch
  with their Member of Parliament (based on postal code) and allow supporters to opt
  in to the Make Poverty History email list.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>If you are in Toronto
  (or know anyone who could benefit from these tools) here's <a href=\"http://connect-toronto.eventbrite.com/\">an
  invite to an information session on Saturday, Feb. 27th starting at 1pm.</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Looks
  like a fantastic event that will explore the state advocacy software for Canadian
  organizations running online campaigns. The event will focus on the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/connect\">\"Connect\"
  module for Drupal</a>, built by venerable <a href=\"http://www.openconcept.ca/\">Mike
  Gifford</a> and the team at <a href=\"http://www.openconcept.ca/\">Open Concept</a>.
  (An early version of these tools was used for the Greenpeace Canada's <a href=\"http://www.kleercut.net\">Kleercut.net</a>
  campaign.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These tools are only possible with the support of the organizations
  that choose to use them, thus providing the necessary feedback and financial investments
  to make them sustainable. So, if you are working in one of those organizations,
  <a href=\"http://connect-toronto.eventbrite.com/\">go register now!</a></p>"
