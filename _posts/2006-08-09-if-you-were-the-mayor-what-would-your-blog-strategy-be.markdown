	An interesting phone conversation with a colleague working on the <a href="http://www.millerformayor.ca/"> David Miller campaign for Mayor of Toronto </a> left me pondering the question: If I were the Mayor of Toronto, what would my blog strategy be? It&#8217;s an interesting question for our current Mayor &#8212; David Miller &#8212; who ran as the &#8220;underdog&#8221; in the last election and now runs again almost unchallenged. Aside from the obvious implications that this has for Miller&#8217;s fundraising strategy, it also occurred to me that it would impact his campaign&#8217;s initiatives around blogging and mobilizing the &#8220;netroots.&#8221; In short, it seems that the key questions are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Who will pen and post the entries?</b> Will they be presented as Miller&#8217;s own? I suspect that most readers would assume that Mayor Miller has very little time for blogging, and therefor would question the authorship if presented that way. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Who will the audience of this blog be?</b> Who is this initiative aimed at? Is it just a &#8220;recent news&#8221; bucket? If it is, I suspect that the real bloggers will be unimpressed. If it isn&#8217;t, then I suspect the audience for the content will need to be well thought out. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Why blog?</b> What are the campaign outcomes that a blog will facilitate? How can that be measured? In a (mostly) unchallenged race, many of the de-facto advantages of having a blog &#8212; Google rankings, authenticity, convening a conversation with potential supporters, the appearance of being &#8220;hip,&#8221; etc. &#8212; may not fit with a strong incumbent-oriented strategy. 
	</li>
	<li>
		And, of course, the ever-tricky (for politics) question: <b> comments. </b> What&#8217;s the strategy here: <em> on </em> or <b> off</b>? 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I had a few ideas on that call &#8212; inspired by my colleagues <a href="http://davidcrow.ca"> David Crow </a> and <a href="http://singer.to"> Eli Singer </a> (and many, many, others) &#8212; and, with a couple weeks to noodle it further, here are some quick thoughts: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b> Authorship: </b> for many positions (e.g., city councillor), I feel that the posts should almost always be authored by (or appear to be authored by) the person running for office. However, for a top-dog position, like Mayor or Premier, or Prime Minister, I feel that it would be more honest to have official campaign bloggers, that are not the person running, as the author(s) of the posts. A great example (that I probably reference too often) was the personality of the Howard Dean campaign that many of us got to know via e-mail: <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tripp"> Joe Trippi</a>. There are many other examples like this. Also, another approach entirely, is the guest blogger or &#8220;embedded blogger,&#8221; which would give a number of people the privileged position of posting on the Mayor&#8217;s blog, either reporting on events or waxing poetic about City-focused issues. Either way, unless Miller&#8217;s going to write it himself &#8212; and it can be short if he does choose to! (hint-hint, wink-wink) &#8212; I don&#8217;t feel posts should be marked as &#8220;Submitted by David Miller.&#8221; 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Audience: </b> Trickier question here&#8230; because it is widely known that, as popular as they are, there are probably only a small number of people that actually care about blogs in any given campaign&#8217;s audience (potential or otherwise). So, given the complexity around the 2-way conversation that blogs often create and the political need for &#8220;containment&#8221; of certain information, it seems only sensible to ask: Who are we writing this damn blog for anyway? If it is, at its simplest, a way of providing a view into the campaign tent (so to speak) by journalling events, appearances, and other tidbits, then I think there&#8217;s real value in defining the audience broadly and writing the posts in a way that is targeted to their interests. If it is, instead, an effort to compel support from the &#8220;netroots&#8221; &#8212; the growing number of popular Toronto-based bloggers and online publishers &#8212; then I feel that the content will need to be quite different. Both are worthy of consideration: but what is the strategy? Is is about extending the reach of announcements to non-traditional media? Or is it about giving supporters that warm-and-fuzzy feeling? 
	</li>
	<li>
		<b> Goals and outcomes: </b> The strategy should have some clear outcomes and measurements (as any strategy should) that make it possible to evaluate the effort(s) and re-orient or re-jig as necessary. Quickly, I would think that keys for Miller might be: 
	<ul>
	<li>Extending the campaign&#8217;s reach into the non-traditional media market</li>
	<li>Finding new pockets of supporters, volunteers, and endorsements from influencers</li>
	<li>And demonstrating a level of media savvy that younger voters might be expect or be impressed by </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<p>
Each of these goals is <b>measurable</b>. And, if any resources are going to be invested here, measurements should be decided on from day one, to ensure that appropriate interventions are set-up to track this data. For example, special donation links in blog posts that provide simple tracking of donation by source; or signing up for an alerts service to track online media hits the same way you would for traditional media.
</p>

		<li><b> Comments: </b> As I said plainly on the phone in that first conversation: if there are no comments, <em> it&#8217;s not a blog</em>. Blogs are probably the biggest campaign idea of the last year or so and, at the same time, they are the campaign manager and communication director&#8217;s worst nightmare. It&#8217;s added work and there&#8217;s potential for big, often innocent, faux pas. But, <em> turning comments off is not the answer! </em> My suggestion: <em> a clear, simple, and firmly stated set of comment guidelines </em> and, if necessary, a statement of editorial policy about the how, when, and why of comment approval. For example, make the rules of commentary clear and then put it plainly: 
		<blockquote>
		<em> We&#8217;re a volunteer-driven campaign and, as such, we have limited resources to post every comment that comes in, given the approvals that are required. However, we will <b>review</b> every comment and make an effort to publish the most insightful ones publicly</em>.
		</blockquote>
Fellow bloggers: am I wrong here? There are many examples of sites (usually large publishers) that apply similar filters to comments and I personally feel that&#8217;s fine, as long as it&#8217;s clearly stated. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Okay, so just to wrap-up, here are a few other ideas for the pile for candidates that want to reach out to the influential blogging community in Toronto:

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Invite the key bloggers to your important campaign events. Or, better yet, have an event for bloggers. </lI>
	<li>My suggestion if you need advise on a blog strategy: hold an event for bloggers and <em> ask them </em> what your strategy should be.</li>
	<li>This one&#8217;s from some US campaigns: invite bloggers &#8212; along with the traditional media &#8212; to your media announcement events or conference calls. Even better: offer them one-on-one interviews.</li>
	<li>Provide a framework and then offer &#8220;guest blogger&#8221; status on your blog. As long as the intentions and editorial policy are upfront, it might just work. </li>
</ul>


<p>
	So I leave you with the question: <big><b>what would your blog strategy for Mayor Miller be? </b></big>
