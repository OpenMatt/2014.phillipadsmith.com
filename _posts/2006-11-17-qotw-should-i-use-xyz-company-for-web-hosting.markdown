title: 'QOTW: Should I use XYZ company for Web hosting?'

excerpt: |-
  <p>This will be the first in what is hopefully an ongoing series of "<a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/tags/qotw">Question of the week</a>" posts. I get a lot of questions from clients, friends, and peers that seem to require a similar answer every time. So, in an effort to beat you to the punch (and to save myself from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">repetitive strain injury</a>), I'm just going to try and post a summary of my most common answers here.</p>

  <h2>This week: Should I use XYZ company for hosting?</h2>

  <p>I get this one so often that it actually hurts (well, not really, but I feel like a painfully broken record). It usually goes something like "I just received our bill for the our Web site, and it reminded me that someone suggested such-and-such hosting. They seem like a cheaper alternative..."</p>

  <p>Of course, in passing conversation, there's nothing wrong with a question like that. <em>But</em>, when that hosting is for a values-aligned organization -- an environmental group, a social-service organization, a social-mission business or social enterprise, an NGO, etc. -- <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/putting-people-first">I feel that the decision should carry more weight</a>.</p>

<h2>This week: Should I use XYZ company for hosting?</h2>

<p>I get this one so often that it actually hurts (well, not really, but I feel like a painfully broken record). It usually goes something like "I just received our bill for the our Web site, and it reminded me that someone suggested such-and-such hosting. They seem like a cheaper alternative..."</p>

<p>Of course, in passing conversation, there's nothing wrong with a question like that. <em>But</em>, when that hosting is for a values-aligned organization -- an environmental group, a social-service organization, a social-mission business or social enterprise, an NGO, etc. -- <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/putting-people-first">I feel that the decision should carry more weight</a>.
<!--break-->
For example, what if I asked my environmental colleagues a question about buying <a href="http://kleercut.net">tissue products</a>? Should I switch from 100% post-consumer recycled to the <a href="http://kleercut.net">forest-destroying alternative</a> just because it's cheaper? Gosh: I hope not! So why is it different when we're talking about Web hosting? </p>

<p>So, here's the run-down: if you're an ethically-guided person, make the ethical choice -- shop local, buy organic, have as little impact on the environment as possible -- by taking the time to look for a Web hosting company that matches your values. Here's a few to get you started (and remember, the more we ask for alternatives, the more we'll see):</p>

<li><a href="http://web.ca">Web Networks: Toronto-based, non-profit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.korax.net">Korax: Toronto-based host</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Green, environmentally focused, or ethically guided</h3>
