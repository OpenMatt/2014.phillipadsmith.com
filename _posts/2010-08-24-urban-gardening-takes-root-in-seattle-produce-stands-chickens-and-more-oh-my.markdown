title: 'Urban gardening takes root in Seattle: Produce stands, chickens, and more,
  oh my!'
date: '2010-08-24 19:20:19 -0500'
excerpt: |-
  <p>This past weekend, I had the opportunity to spend time with a roomful of people doing some pretty inspiring work (one of the best perks of my job!). One of those people was <a href="http://cityofseattle.net/council/Conlin/">Richard Conlin</a>, Council President for the City of Seattle. </p>

  <p>For several years now, Richard has worked to help make Seattle a more livable city. <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/archives/218279.asp">This past Monday</a>, Seattle become one of the few places in the States where you can:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Grow food on your residential and sell it there too (think curb-side fruit stands in every community). </li>
  <li>Put a small, food-producing, greenhouse on your roof</li>
  <li>And -- garnering a surprising amount of attention, and praise -- the ability to raise up to eight chickens in your backyard. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is only the latest development in what is an impressive record of achievements toward making Seattle one of the most green, low-waste, and energy-efficient cities in the US.</p>

  <p>Richard -- who <strong>biked</strong> from his home in Seattle to the gathering on Bainbridge Island -- brims with enthusiasm when talking about urban farming, community gardening, and the <a href="http://conlin.seattle.gov/2010/08/17/zero-waste-on-the-critical-path-for-carbon-neutrality/">potential for Seattle to become a zero-waste city</a>. </p>

  <p>Canada needs to find a way to import some of this vision and execution to our city councils. Toronto, I'm lookin' at you. </p>
