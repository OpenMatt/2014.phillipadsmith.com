excerpt: "<p>Looks like one of my fav online publications, <a href=\"http://grist.com\">Grist</a>,
  is deepening their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management\">CRM</a>
  commitments with <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/npsf/browse_thread/thread/99b174eaa52cb54?hl=en\">an
  RFP for a Salesforce expert</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hello all. </p>\n  \n
  \ <p>Grist uses <a href=\"http://salesforce.com\">Salesforce</a>, but needs a hand
  at optimizing our instance. \n  Instead of attacking this in a piecemeal fashion,
  we've decided to \n  bundle this into a little RFP, and put it in front of our favorite
  \n  people: you. Having been on either end of many arrangements of this \n  kind,
  I understand how hard it can be to pin-down hours, so getting \n  ballparks and
  an hourly rate will help us make our decision. </p>\n  \n  <p>We look forward to
  hearing from you. </p>\n  \n  <p>-Dean </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As long as I've
  known the folks at Grist, they've had ambitious aims for data on their readers,
  supporter, and online community. Dean and I had a chance to talk a a bit about their
  push to integrate Salesforce <a href=\"http://webofchange.com\">back in September</a>,
  so I'll be excited to hear where this latest push takes them. Go Grist!</p>"
