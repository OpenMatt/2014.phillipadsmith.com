I attended a great little meet-up last night. It was the second gathering of [Processing-js Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/Processing-js-Toronto/) -- a group that brings together several of the people working on [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) (many of whom are based in Toronto at [Seneca College's Centre for Development of Open Technology](http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)), and those wanting to learn more about the Web-friendly port of the powerful [Procesisng](http://processing.org/) data visualization language.

The meet-up happened in the 'Media Operations' section of the Toronto [CBC offices](http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?q=cbc+office+toronto&cid=3146766191027858336), which was a fun venue to get to visit. One might wonder why the CBC, but the logic is sort of obvious: tools like Processing and Processing.js are great for exploring and presenting data -- both in print, and online.

The CBC's [Stephen Boyd](https://twitter.com/#!/sspboyd) presented a few newsroom-related projects that he's working on with processing, like:

* Visualizing the CBC Web site's comment volume and 'velocity' on different stories;

* Visualizing twitter posts with the #VoteTO hashtag, and then analyzing them for a candidate's name from the most recent Toronto municipal election. (According to the data, George Smitherman should have won by a large margin.)

I've been keen to try some similar visualization techniques to create dashboards for contributors to [TheTyee.ca](http://TheTyee.ca), so now I've got some incentive (and I know who to bug when I have questions).

There were a lot of great resources that got shared last night -- here's a sampling:

* [PJSBox](http://sanchothefat.com/labs/161/pjsbox): PJSBox will run any Processing code you have selected in a lightbox. Magic!

* [toxiclibs.js](http://haptic-data.com/toxiclibsjs/): Toxiclibs.js is an open-source computational design library ported to javascript. Similar to Processing itself, this library has been ported from Java to work on the Web and is a great companion to Processing.js.

* [twitter-text-js](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text-js): A JavaScript utility that provides text processing routines for Tweets.

* [processingjstool](https://github.com/fjenett/processingjstool): A tool for the Processing IDE that exports sketches as HTML+processing.js. Obviously, quite helpful if you're coming from Processing to Processing.js.

I was also introduced to the work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://www.shiffman.net/) and the [Nature of Code](http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/nature/) through this [port of Flocking](http://haptic-data.com/toxiclibsjs/examples/ShiffmanFlocking_pjs.html). Beautiful stuff.

Also amazing is that Mr. Shiffman's [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiffman/the-nature-of-code-book-project), which promises to turn the Nature of Code into a real book, greatly overshot its goal of $5,000, raising more than $30,000. Gotta' love the Internets.

Last but not least, was a full-length viewing of the [latest HTML5 magic from Google](http://www.ro.me). A must watch, if you have not seen it yet.

Great meet-up. Amazingly-creative people. My only suggestion: **Fewer demos, more sketching!**  :)
