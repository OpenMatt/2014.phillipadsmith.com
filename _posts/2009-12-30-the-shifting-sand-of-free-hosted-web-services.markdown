title: The shifting sand of "free" hosted Web services
date: '2009-12-30 19:40:33 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>I stumbled on the \"lifestream\" blog of <a href=\"http://www.coryobrien.com/\">Cory
  O'Brien</a> today. Being a fan of \"lifestreams\" (an aggregation of 'actions' taken
  on various sites) myself, I was interested to find that Cory's site was running
  on an lifestream aggregation platform called <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/sweetcron/\">Sweet
  Cron</a>, which was new to me. Sweet Cron is an open-source PHP-based application
  developed by \"<a href=\"http://yongfook.com/why-posterous-instead-of-sweetcron\">yongfook</a>.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
  developer, however, has <a href=\"http://yongfook.com/why-posterous-instead-of-sweetcron\">since
  moved</a> his own lifestream/blog to the free service called <a href=\"http://posterous.com/\">Posterous</a>.
  Posterous, like <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/why-tumblr\">Tumblr</a> makes blogging
  easy, which is great. However, Posterous, like Tumblr, also has a very opaque business
  plan. Call me cynical: but I can't get my head around relying on \"free\" hosted
  Web services for more than transient projects. (I'm even starting to question my
  own previous musings about a \"<a href=\"http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/software-pyramid\r\n\">Software
  pyramid for a healthy non-profit</a>\".)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the recent purchase
  of <a href=\"http://etherpad.com/ep/blog/posts/google-acquires-appjet\">EtherPad</a>
  by Google -- leaving even their <b>paid customers</b> in the lurch -- to the quiet
  shut down of free service <a href=\"http://3ft9.com/10-twitapps-shutting-down\">TwitApps</a>,
  it seems that hosted services -- paid or not -- can be volatile ground these days.
  There's a long list of web services that have joined the \"<a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/deadpool/\">dead
  pool</a>\" over the last few years -- I know that I've been bitten more than once
  (<a href=\"http://mentalized.net/journal/2008/05/27/stikipad_when_software_in_the_cloud_goes_sour/\">Stikipad</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/01/magnolia-suffer/\">Ma.gnolia</a>,
  etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you've read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Free-Future-Radical-Chris-Anderson/dp/1401322905\">Free</a>
  by <em>Wired magazine</em> editor Chris Anderson, you'll know that most of these
  services aren't free by any means; they are simply going for the largest market
  possible to make it feasible for 5% of users to pay the freight for the other 95%.
  If they can't reach the mass market necessary to succeed, troubling times lay ahead
  for the service's users. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough of these free services have shut
  down that I've started moving toward installed software again for my own personal
  needs. After enough wasted time looking for half-baked free services, I've found
  it becomes worthwhile to invest in running the service myself on my own infrastructure.
  Your mileage may vary of course. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that said, I'm sincerely curious
  about what others are doing: Are you relying more-and-more on free services like
  Posterous and Tumblr? Do you think about the day of reckoning when, inevitability,
  they introduce a premium plan, sell your data, or show ads on your site? Do you
  back up your data regularly, or just have faith that all will be okay? Or, alternately,
  are you starting to dust off your old programming books and getting to work on your
  own solutions?</p>"
