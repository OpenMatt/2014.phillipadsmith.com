<p>Yes, it's true: after <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/working-from-south-america">a one-year adventure and exploration of living and working in South America</a>, we are back in Canada (more specifically, Toronto). So, now that we've had a chance to settle in and surprise a few friends here and there, I thought I should probably post an "official" update.

<p>On the <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca">Community Bandwidth</a> side of life, I'm excited to be able to continue my work with a number of passionate independent publishers and progressive media organizations. More than ever, I believe that "media activism is the new environmental movement." Watching the issues that I feel passionate about ignored by mainstream press is frustrating -- but I jump out of bed every morning with the knowledge that the global media ecosystem is in a period of massive change and there is much work to be done toward reshaping it. </p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/">personal side of life</a>, its amazing to re-connect with our community in Toronto and to be close to family and friends again. Their excitement at having us back is like rocket fuel (the environmentally-friendly and sustainable kind, of course!).</p>

<p>When we set out for South America, I tried to keep the <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/moving-right-along">list of ambitions</a> small: catch my breath and reflect on <strike>five</strike> seven (!) years of hard work running Community Bandwidth, spend some time planning for this year, make new friends in South America, put some volunteer hours into open-source projects, and -- most importantly -- to scheme with colleagues in the media reform movement. </p>

<p>I'm happy to report that they were all achieved and I had fun in the process of working on them; not to mention the enjoyment of learning a new language (Spanish) and finding my way to the gym more frequently that I ever had in the past. All-in-all, it was a life-changing experience that I would highly recommend to others. </p>

<p>That's it for today.
