	</p><p>Recently, I've been reading with great interest about the future of Perl, and -- more specifically -- about <a href="http://use.perl.org/%7EOvid/journal/39344">how the "outside" sees Perl</a> and how Perl <a href="http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/07/1248529850.html">might need a director of marketing</a>. Frankly, and at the risk of rocking the boat, I'll propose that Perl needs more than just a marketing director, or someone on the "outside" to do a survey; Put simply: Perl needs a <strong>creative agitator</strong>. (Or, perhaps more appropriately, a creative benevolent&nbsp;dictator.)</p> 
  <p>Though I've been using Perl on-and-off for more than ten years, I'm relatively new to the "Perl community." I've been involved with promoting free and open-source software since 1999 -- writing articles, organizing events, and so on -- and sometime in 2005, while interviewing the fine folks at Portland's <a href="http://www.freegeek.org/">FreeGeek</a> project, I was pulled back into the world of&nbsp;Perl.</p> 
  <p>At that time, my initial reaction was: <strong>Is the Perl community&nbsp;schizophrenic?</strong> </p> 
  <p>As far as visual presentation goes (dare I say "branding?"), the Perl community is all over the place. Spread across a dizzying array of Web sites -- perl.org, use.perl.org, perldoc.perl.org, Perl Monks, Perl Mongers, <span class="caps">CPAN</span>, and so on -- and each with its own entirely unique visual identity, the Perl community fails at presenting an easy-to-understand and easy-to-navigate information space. (Perhaps a bit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it"><span class="caps">TMTOWTDI</span></a> gone&nbsp;awry?)</p> 
  <p><strong>Don't believe me?</strong> I present to you the world of Perl as it looks to the&nbsp;outside:</p> 
  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phillipadsmith/3760674392/" title="Is the Perl community schizophrenic?   by phillipadsmith, on Flickr"><img style="border: 1px solid rgb(102, 102, 102); padding: 20px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2489/3760674392_da2fc29613_o.jpg" alt="Is the Perl community schizophrenic?  " height="418" width="500" /></a></p> 
  <p><strong>Why is this a problem?</strong> I believe it's a problem because first impressions matter. For those new to programming who are in search of the right language, there's a lot of information to slog through. Younger languages like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and frameworks like <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, are making their case upfront, concisely, and in a visually compelling way. (Something that Perl.org fails at, in my humble&nbsp;opinion.)</p> 
  <p>It's also problem because we are in a time where the Web <em>is</em> the platform, and everyday programming is less likely to be strictly confined to some dark corner where it can hide away its ugliness. I believe this is partly why there are movements within the Perl community toward a "modern Perl," and an "enlightened Perl," and toward providing the <a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/05/04/exploring-perl-web-frameworks/">various Perl (a-hem) <em>Web</em> frameworks</a> that we have to choose from now. The trend is toward a better-looking Perl, an object-oriented Perl, a Perl that is more Web-native, and -- ultimately -- a Perl that the whole community can be proud&nbsp;of.</p> 
  <p>In conclusion: <em>improving the outside perception of Perl is going to take more than just&nbsp;blogging.</em> </p> 
  <p>That's it for today. Next up: A closer look at the Perl visual identities in the&nbsp;wild. </p>
