<p>After stumbling on the new <a href="http://csod-demo.civicspaceondemand.org/">Civicspace On Demand demo</a> late last week, I got this public announcement  from the <a href="http://civicspacelabs.org/LLC">Civicspace team</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had already given the on-line demo a whirl -- considering it for a few key clients -- and found it to be fast, responsive, and easy-to-use. Some of the interface improvements for this version are spectacular and well-tailored to the needs of NGOs. However, as has always been the case, Civicspace remains a US-centric system in many ways.</p>

<p>That said, as I've done with the <a href="http://www.kleercut.net/en/open-source-campaigning">Kleercut.net</a> site for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.ca">Greenpeace</a>, it's fairly straightforward to make it more friendly for Canadian organizations, including the option of making the public Web site bi-lingual. And, with the addition of CiviCRM and CiviContribute, it's a powerful tool for <a href="http://rowenasantos.ca">municipal election campaigns</a> among other things. </p>

<p>I'm dying to give the new "on demand" product a try on a real campaign: any ideas?  ;-)</p>
