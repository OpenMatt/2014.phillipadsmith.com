<p>One of <a href="http://briarpatchmagazine.com">my favourite Canadian publications</a> is <a href="http://briarpatchmagazine.com/jobs">looking for an Editor/Drafter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>
Application deadline: March 1, 2010
</b></p>
<p>
Are you passionate about independent media and progressive/radical politics? Are you a talented communicator with an entrepreneurial spirit, ready to take the reins of a respected Canadian magazine? Do you want to work for a grassroots organization that enables you to put your politics into practice?
</p>
<p>
As part of a shift into participatory economics and balanced job complexes, Briarpatch seeks a crackerjack Editor/Drafter to jointly oversee all aspects of producing a bi-monthly magazine.
</p>
<p>
As one of two full-time staff in a horizontal workplace, the successful candidate will share equal responsibility for core editorial, organizational and administrative tasks, and will report directly to a volunteer board of directors.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been passionately reading Briarpatch since <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/a-progressive-media-alliance">meeting Dave Mitchel at an IPA gathering in San Francisco some four years ago</a>. Under Dave's leadership, Briarpatch has been one hell of a publication for its size; always blazing a trail editorially and doing a lot with limited resources.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a place to innovate, I would recommend <a href="http://briarpatchmagazine.com/jobs">checking out this opportunity</a>.</p>
