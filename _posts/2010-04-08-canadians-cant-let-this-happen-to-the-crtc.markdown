title: Canadians can't let this happen to the CRTC
date: '2010-04-08 13:00:16 -0500'
excerpt: "<p>\r\n\tOver lunch with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/OpenMatt\">Matt Thompson</a>
  earlier this week, I was lamenting the U.S Court of Appeals <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/90747-fcc-dealt-major-blow-in-net-neutrality-ruling-favoring-comcast\">had
  ruled</a> that FCC \"<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/06/federal-court-tells-fcc-it-does-not-have-authority-to-enforce-net-neutrality/\">did
  not have the authority to order Comcast to stop slowing down BitTorrent traffic</a>\"
  and -- in effect -- doesn't have the authority to enforce <a class=\"zem_slink\"
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality\" title=\"Network neutrality\"
  rel=\"wikipedia\">net neutrality</a>. This is an issue that Matt had worked on for
  years and one that is near-and-dear to his heart.&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMatt shared with me some of the battles that were fought
  while he was working on the <a href=\"http://www.savetheinternet.com/\">Save The
  Internet campaign</a> and -- interestingly -- how some of the organizations working
  in the \"<a href=\"http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/openwebistwothings/\">open
  Internet</a>\" space don't support the FCC, or -- more specifically -- the idea
  of any regulation of the Internet at all. Matt pointed out, correctly I think, that
  this lack of government regulation creates exactly the right kind of environment
  for the opposite of regulation -- Monopolization. And with monopolies -- like Bell
  and Rogers to date in Canada -- the average citizen gets an entirely different kind
  of regulation, and it's usually not the kind that favours <a class=\"zem_slink\"
  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Canada\" title=\"Culture of Canada\"
  rel=\"wikipedia\">Canadian culture</a>, openness, or anything other than the interests
  of the monopoly.&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://eaves.ca\">David
  Eaves</a> had <a href=\"http://eaves.ca/2010/03/31/the-future-of-media-in-canada-thoughts-for-the-canadian-parliamentary-committee/\">recently
  offered up</a> thoughts for the Canadian Parliamentary committee on \"the future
  of media in Canada\" and that post echoed some of the sentiments that I've also
  heard from those that favour an open Internet, but seek less government regulation.
  In Canada's case, this is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission\">CRTC</a>,
  which is by no means a perfect organization. However, I fear the call to limit the
  CRTC's ability to regulate the Internet in Canada. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn
  article <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/07/fcc-comcast-decision-casts-a-shadow-on-broadband-plan/\">published
  yesterday on TechCrunch about the ruling that impacts the FCC</a> has an insightful
  quote (the bold is mine): \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\"
  style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\">\r\n\t“Yesterday’s decision
  may affect a significant number of important Plan recommendations. <b>&nbsp;Among
  them are recommendations aimed at accelerating broadband access and adoption in
  rural America; connecting low-income Americans, Native American communities, and
  Americans with disabilities; supporting robust use of broadband by small businesses
  to drive productivity, growth and ongoing innovation; lowering barriers that hinder
  broadband deployment; strengthening public safety communications; cybersecurity;
  consumer protection, including transparency and disclosure; and consumer privacy</b>.
  The Commission must have a sound legal basis for implementing each of these recommendations.
  We are assessing the implications of yesterday’s decision for each one, to ensure
  that the Commission has adequate authority to execute the mission laid out in the
  Plan.” \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tReading the implications of the&nbsp;U.S
  Court of Appeals ruling struck a cord with me; more so in light of a piece that
  I read in last week's Globe about \"Canada's <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide\"
  title=\"Digital divide\" rel=\"wikipedia\">digital divide</a>\" that points out
  \"<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadas-digital-divide/article1521631/\">As
  urban centres rush to build high-speed broadband networks to keep up with exploding
  demand, many rural regions are being left behind.</a>\"&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCanada's competitive future and cultural future both require
  an open, fast, and relatively unobstructed Internet. Canadian citizens -- and, thus,
  Canadian democracy -- require the same. The CRTC and its attempts to enforce Canadian
  content rules on the Internet may be misguided -- I am not arguing with that --
