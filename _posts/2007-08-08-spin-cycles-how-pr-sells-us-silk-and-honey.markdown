title: 'Spin Cycles: How PR sells us Silk and Honey'
date: '2007-08-08 14:07:57 -0500'
excerpt: |-
  <p>So I've just started replacing sugar and milk in my coffee. It's been a few days now and I barely miss it; the secret was <a href="http://www.silksoymilk.com/Products/SilkCreamer.aspx">Silk</a> and honey. I can't stand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia">Stevia</a> or those other "healthy" sugar replacements -- but this combo works beautifully. And <strong>what else is like silk and honey for us Canadians?</strong> Why the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">CBC</a> of course.</p>

  <p>I stumbled on a great five-part series on CBC radio this weekend called <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/spincycles/index.html">Spin Cycles</a>. The series covers the history, and current state, of the PR industry. The host explores this industry in relation to US and Canadian politics, and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the result is a thorough investigation "how those in power can manipulate facts in order to make their case for the rest of us."</p>

  <p>I highly recommend a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/spincycles/index.html">listen</a>.</p>
