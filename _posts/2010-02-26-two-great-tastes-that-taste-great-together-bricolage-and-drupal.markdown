excerpt: "<p>Long-time \"Bricoleur\" Chris Schults reports that every Seattleite's
  favourite co-op, PCC Natural Markets (the largest consumer-owned natural food retail
  co-operative in the United States), has just re-launched their Web property using
  <a href=\"http://www.bricolagecms.org\">BricolageCMS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drupal.or\">Drupal</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Last
  week PCC launched its redesigned website, which is a blend of\r\nBricolage, Drupal
  and custom PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the response has been very positive, and I
  invite you to give\r\nthe new site a whirl:</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/\">http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I
  had the pleasure of meeting Chris, if ever so briefly, while we were both working
  on a re-launch of online daily environmental news site <a href=\"http://www.grist.org\">Grist.org</a>
  in 2004, which was re-built using <a href=\"http://www.bricolagecms.org\">BricolageCMS</a>
  (now running Expression Engine, I believe). Five years later and Chris is the Bricolage
  expert -- I love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, online daily news site <a href=\"http://www.thetyee.ca\">TheTyee.ca</a>
  made a <a href=\"http://homeofficekernel.blogspot.com/2009/07/tyee-bricolage-and-drupal-integration.html\">similar
  decision to use BricolageCMS and Drupal</a> when they upgraded their Web operation
  recently, and they've <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/bricolage\">contributed
  a model</a> to help folks make similar integrations.</p>"
