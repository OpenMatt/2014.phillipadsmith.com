title: Only 2 weeks left to enter $5 million Knight News Challenge
date: '2007-10-04 15:09:09 -0500'
excerpt: |-
  <p>Marc Fest (Director of Communications at the <a href="http://www.knightfdn.org/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>) asked me to pass this on:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Knight News Challenge contest awards $5 million for innovative media ideas, however the October 15 application deadline is quickly approaching. The streamlined application takes less than 20 minutes. Anybody worldwide has a chance to win. For more information and to apply visit <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org">www.newschallenge.org</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Knight News Challenge is one of the more innovative funding models that I referenced recently in a post about <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/funding-two-dot-oh">changing technology funding practices</a>. Their approach to granting -- both the application process and the fast, iterative funding cycles -- is having a catalyzing effect, and a noticeable impact, on the shape of local news around the world. </p>

  <p>If you're involved with a citizen or local media project: get that pencil sharpened and start writing.</p>
