<p>The tools that are available for combining images, audio, and text have just become too easy to use for publications to ignore. Many magazines are <em>already</em> doing the work of recording interviews, shooting photographs, and building out a theme for their editorial packages. So the question is: what are the opportunities to leverage these simple tools to bring a story to life online? </p>

<p>Even though <a href="http://eyetrack.poynter.org/">recent studies</a> are showing that people read more, and more deeply, online than in print, there's a growing trend across Web publications to add multi-media storytelling to the mix. From the audio-only podcast -- like the <a href="http://rabble.ca/rpn">rabble's podcast network</a> -- to the <a href="guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1101132,00.html">Flash-enabled experiences</a> that are starting to be commonplace on most large news sites, everyone has finally figured out that people want more than just text. </p>

<p>Given that <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/so-you-want-to-podcast-eh">I've already touched on podcasting</a>, I wanted to share what online publications were up to around multi-media experiences; and how hard (or easy!) it would be for more publications to put these tools to use.</p>

<p>Great examples are everywhere. I spent hours just exploring <a href="http://bop.nppa.org/2007/web_sites/winners/">the 2007 Web site winners</a> of the <a href="http://www.nppa.org/">National Press Photographers Association's</a> "Best of Photojournalism 2007." The diversity of the winning sites is impressive: everything from <a href="http://www.mercurynewsphoto.com/">San Jose Mercury News Photography Department's archive</a>, to <a href="http://bop.nppa.org/2007/web_sites/winners/PJB/87038/87038.html">simple Flickr slideshows and blogs</a>.</p>

<p>How easy is it to create an photo slideshow? Or even a narrated slideshow? <strong>Really easy.</strong> </p>

<p>Though there are lots of tools to choose from, the most impressively simple that I came across was <a href="http://soundslides.com/" title="Soundslides is a rapid production tool for still image and audio web presentations.">Soundslides</a>. Soundslides is a cross-platform (Mac / Windows) "rapid production tool for still image and audio Web presentations" -- built for journalists, this is probably the most intuitive tool that I've ever seen for creating stunning audio-visual slideshows. (I won't bore you with the results... but, as an example of how easy it is to use, I was up-and-running with a nifty narrated slideshow in under 10 minutes.)</p>

<p>As writers, editors, and publishers, you already know how to tell a story: now it's time to just get out there and do it online.</p>
