So, we're five days into the [#MozNewsLab](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23MozNewsLab) experiment and things are **[exploding](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/)** (in a good way, of course).

But we're not in the clear yet...

In the development of this entire Knight-Mozilla program, we received [a lot of great feedback](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.community.mojo/browse_thread/thread/9ecc41342115c7f1#) from people working in newsrooms -- both news-app developers and editorial staff. Some voices were louder than other (**cough**[Derek Willis](https://twitter.com/derekwillis)**cough**), but we heard those voices loud-and-clear and want to work to address as many of the concerns as possible, such as:

* The challenge of incremental change vs. wholesale change in established news organization;

* The idea that 'news apps' are not just about technology, they are pieces of journalism too (and what that means practically);

* How does a new software product or tool make its way into a newsroom? What are the entry points?

* Where are the opportunities to '[Hack at the core](http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/03/matt-waite-to-build-a-digital-future-for-news-developers-have-to-be-able-to-hack-at-the-core-of-the-old-ways/)' of news.

I want to inject as many of these ideas into the thinking that is happening in the #MozNewsLab, but I need your help to make that happen (and it's in your interest to help!).

So, I had an idea the other day about how to do this, and I would like to try it out on all of you, if you're willing.

I wrote about the lab's objectives earlier this week on [PBS MediaShift Idealab](http://ps.ht/nislMv) -- and in that post I referenced the idea of a "**message in a bottle.**"

Well, I'd like _you_ to give it a shot. :)

**The concept is simple**: people working in newsrooms, or with newsrooms, or who have worked in newsrooms (you get the point), send a short video message **into our learning lab**. Once received, Alex and I will assign it as "homework."

These video messages should try to communicate:

* The realities of working in a busy news environment, i.e., the hurdles that fellows might face when they arrive at Al Jazeera English, BBC, Boston.com, Guardian, or Zeit Online this year (and perhaps [your news organization](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Mojo/Selection) next year);

* The challenges that reporters are facing today, i.e., tools they really wish they had to report or present news;

* The challenges that news users are facing today, i.e., how news could be better delivered to people who read, use, and re-mix it;

* The failed state of corporate IT, and corporate CMSs, in many large newsrooms, and how to route around that;

... And so on.

Basically, these would be a reality check from those people "in the know" -- like you.

So, your mission -- should you choose to accept it -- would be to:

1. Create a short (~3 minute) web-cam video that boils down your experience into one clear call-to-action for our lab participants, e.g.: "_If you're going to know one thing about trying to work with reporters, and editors, and technology it's ...._" and one clear question for participants, e.g.: "_So, given what I've just told you, how will you work around that?_"

2. Upload that video to YouTube and tag it with #MozNewsLab (or upload it anywhere and send me a link; YouTube just saves me a step or two.)

3. Keep your eye on your Twitter @ replies, and -- as time permits -- engage with the participants that respond.

This is your chance to get your idea, experience, and opinion in front of sixty-three smart people that are hurtling toward the opportunity to spend one year building software in a newsroom.

Let's not let the [#MozNewsLab particiapnts](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/people/) go in blind!  :)
