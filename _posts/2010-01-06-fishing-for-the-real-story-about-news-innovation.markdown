title: Fishing for the real story about news innovation
date: '2010-01-06 23:33:44 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Interviewing the venerable <a href=\"http://thetyee.ca/Bios/David_Beers/\">David
  Beers</a> today, I was reminded about the power of stories. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>David
  is the Founder / Editor of the award-winning daily news site <a href=\"http://www.thetyee.ca\">The
  Tyee</a> and we were speaking about the changing news environment. At times, David
  likes to make himself out to be a fish out of water (pun intended -- a \"tyee\"
  is a salmon): the \"old fashioned\" guy leading the news innovation pack. But it's
  clear to me that it is people like David -- these fish out of water -- that are
  learning to survive in this new environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to hear David's
  stories about news innovation at The Tyee, you can find him (along with more than
  200 other media innovators) at the \"<a href=\"http://journalismthatmatters.org/JTM-PNW\">Journalism
  That Matters: Re-imagining News &amp; Community in the Pacific Northwest</a>\" gathering
  in Seattle this week. You can be sure it won't be a firsherman's tale.</p>"
