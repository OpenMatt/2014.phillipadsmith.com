    <p>
	The interest in improving the <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/perlceptions">perception of Perl</a> is increasing every day (much to my surprise!). From Matt S Trout's <a href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/the-power-of-asking/#last_third">initiative to feed patches back to the maintainers of perl.org</a> to Jon Allen's TPF <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2009/08/2009q3_grant_proposal_improve.html">grant application</a> to &quot;Improve the visual design of Perl websites,&quot; to G&#225;bor Szab&#243;'s &quot;<a href="http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/08/1250064260.html">Measurable objectives for the Perl ecosystem</a>,&quot; each step builds on the next. All of them are tangible and practical steps toward a Perl renaissance online.
</p> 
  <p>
	Of even more interest is the approach. Like many Perl programs of the past, it appears like the first thought is &quot;Let's just fix this fast,&quot; which sometimes can happen even before the problem has been well defined (ahem, spaghetti code anyone?). And while the speed of the &quot;Just Freakin' Do It&quot; approach works when trying to get people excited, it can sometimes miss the mark around harnessing a community's collective wisdom. In my experience, the Perl community has a lot of collective wisdom to tap in to and should be thinking as long term as possible when it comes to re-defining what the Perl community looks like to the outside world. 
</p> 
  <p>
	So, in the interest of pushing the conversation forward another step, I wanted to explore two questions: 
</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>
		What is the Perl community &quot;selling&quot; to the outside world?
	</li> 
    <li>
		Who is the Perl community &quot;selling&quot; its message to? 
	</li> 
  </ol>
