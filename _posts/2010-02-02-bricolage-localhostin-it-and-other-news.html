    <p>I've had my head down in a large <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org">Bricolage CMS</a> project over the last few weeks (well, that and some packing), so it was time that I came up for some air and some technical blogging.  First exciting bit of news to report is <a href="http://justatheory.com">David Wheeler's</a> announcement about the <a href="http://bricolagecms.org/news/announce/2010/01/28/bricolage-1.11.3/">released of Bricolage 1.11.3</a> last week. This is the first (and hopefully last!) beta toward the release of Bricolage 2.0. There is a lot of shiny-new fun in this release, so you should give it a try if you're so inclined. </p> 
  <p>The next bit of fun is also Bricolage related...</p>
