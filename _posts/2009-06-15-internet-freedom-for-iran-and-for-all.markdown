  <p>Internet freedom has become a critical component of functional democracies. Global events like the <a href="http://blog.newint.org/majority/2009/06/15/disputed-landslide/">election</a> <a href="http://blog.newint.org/majority/2009/06/12/just-dont-cheat/">in</a> <a href="http://blog.newint.org/majority/2009/06/10/blinded-by-the-light/">Iran</a> highlight the important role that both Internet freedom and press freedom play in maintaining the balance of power between people and politics. </p>

  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_E._Stiglitz">Joseph E. Stiglitz</a> wrote in his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=geN6MUthHdkC">Globalization and its discontents </a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"We have come to take it for granted the important role that an informed and free press has in reining in even our democratically elected governments: any mischief, any minor indiscretion, any favoritism, is subject to scrutiny, and public pressure works powerfully."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And, should that book be published today, no doubt Stiglitz would note that "an informed and free press" is threatened in all countries, not just Iran, when Internet freedom is undermined. </p>

The relationship between Internet freedom and press freedom becomes even more apparent as traditional "trusted" news sources begin to downsize and file for bankruptcy, in the face of a changing news environment that <a href="http://codybrown.name/2009/06/09/batch-vs-real-time-processing-print-vs-online-journalism-why-the-best-online-news-brands-will-never-look-like-the-new-york-times/">favours "real time," over "batch" processing</a>. As <a href="http://blog.newint.org/majority/2009/02/19/we-are-the-blogosphe/">citizen reporting</a> and other forms of distributed journalism emerge to fill the gaps left by a failing news industrial complex, the importance of Internet freedom surfaces as perhaps the most pressing issue of our time.</p>

<p>Iran's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran">history of Internet censorship</a> is well documented. Its regime against those seeking information, or seeking to inform, would appear to be brutal by most International standards. Nonetheless, its citizens persevere and -- with the help of censorship-circumventing technology -- continue to report what is happening on the ground. </p>

<p>As the grassroots election reporting started flowing out of Iran, there was a noticeable movement to ensure that those in Iran could continue to report the events that were impacting them. Most noticeably, on micro-blogging services like <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IranElection">Twitter</a>, there was an enormous effort to ensure that information about anonymous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">proxy servers</a> -- services that enable people in Iran to communicate with the rest of the free-and-open Internet -- was <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IranElection+proxy">easily available and constantly updated</a>. </p>

<p>These anti-censorship circumvention technologies -- for computers and for mobile phones -- are only necessary when Internet freedoms are restricted. Until such time that basic Internet freedoms are secured for all people, in all countries, there will need to be a strong movement of "radical technologists" that work to challenge these restrictions in all of their forms. </p>

<p>The Internet situation in Iran is just foreshadowing for the rest of the world. It's not just direct censorship of the Internet, or country-wide filtering and firewalls, that are the problem. In many countries, there is active lobbying underway to create a new "tiered" Internet that would concentrate too much power in the hands of a few telecommunications monopolies. This attack on basic freedom of the Internet -- the freedoms that are protected by "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a>" -- is simply a back-room dealing to create the same restrictions without being as overt. </p>
