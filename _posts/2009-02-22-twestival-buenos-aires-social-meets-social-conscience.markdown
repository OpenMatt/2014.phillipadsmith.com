  <p>It's hard to believe that it's been a week and a day since Melanie and I fixed our resolve, swallowed our timidity, and jumped right in to <a href="http://buenosaires.twestival.com/">Twestival Buenos Aires</a>. Our joint objective: To not embarrass ourselves or our respective nations at this international solidarity event.</p>

  <p>Twestival, if this is the first you've heard of it, is a grassroots, locally organized, globally-simultaneous event. Along the lines of self-organized knowledge gatherings like <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>, the Twestival organizers simply established the framework and let the Internet do the rest. And following in the footsteps of more recent events like <a href="http://hohoto.ca/">#HoHoTo</a> in Toronto, the event was equal parts social and social conscience: all proceeds from Twestival were donated to <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/about/">a charity working to bring clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations</a>.</p>

  <p>Globally, Twestival raised a stunning $250,000 USD, which (according to the Twestival site) pays for 55 water projects in places like Ethiopia, Uganda and India -- clean water for just over 17,000 people.</p>

  <p>So who were these people? </p>

<p>So who were these people? 
<!--break-->
Basically, people just like <a href="http://twitter.com/melanieredman">Melanie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/phillipadsmith">me</a> (okay, well, maybe more like me, in the sense that they were a little bit on the nerdier end of the spectrum). Twestival -- the Twitter festival -- brings together folks who engage in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-blogging">micro-blogging phenomenon</a> using the service called <a href="http://twitter.com/about">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Like I said before, we were there to have a good time, fraternize with the locals, donate to a great cause, and -- most importantly -- to <strong>not embarrass ourselves</strong>. Unfortunately, moments after we arrived, not knowing anyone, and speaking barely a word of Castellano, we got caught on video -- oh god! </p>

<p>You can catch our cameo <a href="http://vimeo.com/3204511?pg=embed&amp;sec=#embed">here</a> or in the player below (we're about 1 minute and 20 seconds into the clip)</p>

<div align="center" style="margin:20px 0 20px 0;"><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3204511&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3204511&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></div>

<p>So what's the moral of this story? Well, I would say it's something like this... you <em>too</em> can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move to a new country (continent even!),</li>
<li>take five language classes (two hours each),</li>
<li>and, within eleven days, feel comfortable enough to crash a geek party and not make an ass of yourself (well, um, just don't get caught on camera!). </li>
</ul>

<p>Onward. </p>
