title: Technology is not the issue. Here come the web thinkers.
date: '2010-03-17 15:56:44 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Web of Change alums <a href=\"http://birocreative.com/\">Tim Walker</a>
  &amp; <a href=\"http://echoditto.com/\">Michael Silberman</a> have put together
  <a href=\"http://www.echoditto.com/insights/webthinking\">a manifesto</a> entitled
  \"<a href=\"http://www.echoditto.com/insights/webthinking\">Web thinking: The Choice
  Ahead for Movement-Leading Organizations</a>,\" which presents what organizations
  need to be thinking about in 2010 and beyond to success online (and in general).
  </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Our field is maturing rapidly. The next generation
  of movement leaders is overcoming its fetish with technology and expertise as secrets
  to online success. Indeed, now faced with existential challenges from a fast shifting
  landscape, the time has come for us all to rethink our most deeply held tenets in
  this struggle to remain relevant. Thankfully, a brave few are trying – and they're
  finding answers. Looking beyond traditional online strategy, they're fundamentally
  transforming how they and their organizations work – shifting their entire perspective
  towards what we call \"Web Thinking\" – to better reflect the reality of our time.
  And they're winning. They're charting a path forward for us all.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>The
  teams at EchoDitto and Biro Creative have been tracking and studying this shift
  for more than six years through their work with a wide range of leading social change
  organizations. After a decade of obsessive technology consumption, the sector is
  ready for a new chapter. This manifesto reveals new tenets for success. It is a
  call to arms for our next generation of leaders.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>They
  go on to outline 10 proclamations that organizations should be thinking about in
  relation to their structure, thinking, and strategy about change. There are some
  great ideas there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some ways, it doesn't go far enough. I'll be
  adding my 3 cents, <a href=\"http://www.echoditto.com/insights/webthinking\">why
  not add yours</a>?  </p>"
