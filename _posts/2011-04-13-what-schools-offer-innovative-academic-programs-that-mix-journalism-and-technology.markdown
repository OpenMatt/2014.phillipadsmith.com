I'm working to [compile a list of academic programs](http://help.hackshackers.com/questions/928/what-schools-offer-innovative-academic-programs-that-mix-journalism-and-technolog) that are experimenting in the news-technology space. The list will be used for outreach around the [Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership](http://mzl.la/knightmojo). We'd like to engage as many of the people as possible that have already self-identified as wanting to work at the intersection of journalism, storytelling, and computing -- and academic programs are one of six areas that we want to reach out to, i.e.: undergrads, graduate students, or alums of innovative programs.

Some of the more obvious examples of what I'm looking for are programs like [Studio 20 at NYU](http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/courses-of-study/studio-20/), [Medill's scholarships for programmers](http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/admissions/page.aspx?id=58645), and the new [Tow Centre for Digital Journalism at Columbia University](http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/628-tow-center-for-digital-journalism/426). I know there are more -- hopefully many, many more -- institutions doing this kind of experimentation in an academic setting. Can you help me find them (**and not just the ones in North America**)?

There's a good [list of journalism programs over on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism_school#List_of_journalism_schools_and_programs). Perhaps you know that one of them is doing some really innovative work? If so, please leave a comment below with a one-sentence explanation of what they're doing, and a URL, and I'll add it to the [larger list](http://help.hackshackers.com/questions/928/what-schools-offer-innovative-academic-programs-that-mix-journalism-and-technolog).

I'm also looking for unusual suspects like the [ITP at NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/), or any other programs that are producing potentially [journalism-impacting innovations](https://foursquare.com/).

Again, suggestions for programs **outside of the United States** are highly encouraged.

[Here's the current state of the list]((http://help.hackshackers.com/questions/928/what-schools-offer-innovative-academic-programs-that-mix-journalism-and-technolog) (with thanks to Justin Arenstein, Brian Loffler, and Ross Settles for non-North American pointers).
