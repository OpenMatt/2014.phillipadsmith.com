<p>This just in from <a href="http://filmsthatmove.org/#/about-celina-agaton/4539125687">Celina Agaton</a> of <a href="http://filmsthatmove.org/#/about-celina-agaton/4539125687">Films that Move</a> via the <a href="http://www.marsdd.com/blog/2008/05/16/social-tech-training-comes-to-mars-june-22-24/">Social Tech Training</a> network: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Films That Move presents a <a href="http://filmsthatmovevideo.eventbrite.com/">free video workshop</a> with TV Reporter, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Reyes" title="Kris Reyes" rel="wikipedia">Kris Reyes</a> for non-profit and social enterprise employees and volunteers. </p>
  
  <p><strong>When: Saturday, March 6, 2010 10am to Noon</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where: University of Toronto, Room TBD</strong></p>
  
  <p>What makes for a good story? How can you use the tools of today to 
  help you create your own media? How do we make sure human interest 
  stories don't get lost in the mix? </p>
  
  <p>In this workshop, CityTV reporter Kris Reyes will try to help you 
  answer those questions.  She will also talk about the elements of a 
  good story, how to shoot your own interviews, and share some ideas for 
  creating and distributing your own media.</p>

<p>No agenda for the morning, but looks like an interesting opportunity for organizations that have <a href="http://filmsthatmovevideo.eventbrite.com/">an interest in exploring video and a Saturday morning to invest</a>. Go register, it's free! </p>
