title: Support Canvassing and GOTV (Get Out The Vote) functionality in CiviCRM
date: '2010-03-15 21:03:06 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>This in late last week (while I was on the mend from some serious food
  poisoning... thanks Peru!) from <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/\">Donald Lobo and
  the CiviCRM team</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Hey folks:</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>We
  are trying to raise some sponsorship $$$ to build <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/blogs/lobo/support-canvassing-and-gotv-get-out-vote-functionality-civicrm\">canvassing
  and get out of the vote support in CiviCRM</a>. Seems like we've got a good combination
  of folks who are interested in working with us to develop it. We've got an excellent
  start from some seed funders, and need a few more funders to meet our goals. If
  the above is of interest to you or your clients, please consider helping out. You
  can make your <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=1\">donation
  here</a> :)</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>The complete specification is on the the wiki:  <a
  href=\"http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/CiviCRM+for+Canvassing+and+GOTV\">CiviCRM
  for Canvassing and GOTV</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This requirement has
  been probably been the #1 reason that many of the electoral campaigns that I've
  supported in the past couldn't get good mileage out of CiviCRM. There was no <em>easy</em>
  way to do the usual canvassing and get out of the vote activities right inside of
  CiviCRM. Sure, it was hackable with custom fields and custom reports, but it never
  worked as well as it could have. If you've had similar experiences, this is your
  chance to fix that. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not <a href=\"http://civicrm.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=1\">sponsor
  some of the development</a>, or commit some developer hours to help out? </p>"
