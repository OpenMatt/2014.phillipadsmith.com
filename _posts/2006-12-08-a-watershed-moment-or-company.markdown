<p>
Announcing a new online relationship building company
</p>

<p>
THE WATERSHED COMPANY
ONLINE FUNDRAISING AND ADVOCACY
San Francisco &amp; DC
(888) 516-8580
</p>

<p>
When it comes to new media have you had enough? Enough...
</p>

<p>
Talk.Talk Talk.
Hype. Hype. Hype.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s face it. Everyone talks about the awesome promise and potential of the
internet. Few have experienced it in any sustained way.
</p>

<p>
Sure, with a Tsunami and a Hurricane Katrina, billions were raised online by
a few organizations.
</p>

<p>
And yes, the presidential candidates like Howard Dean and John Kerry and
even George Bush also attracted millions upon millions - volunteers,
activists, donors. Not to mention the bragging and blogging (largely
unmeasured) that went on in the 2006 mid-term elections.
</p>

<p>
But, if you&rsquo;re not the Red Cross or a popular presidential candidate, and
you really have to show some online results, you&rsquo;re probably asking, &ldquo;What
about the rest of us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Introducing WATERSHED ... A whole new company designed expressly to build,
grow and sustain relationships with your constituents online. And,
thoroughly integrated with your other channels like field organizing,
education, direct mail, telephone, and donor services.
</p>

<p>
No, WATERSHED isn&rsquo;t a software solutions company, even though we know what
software solutions are likely to work best for you. And, no, WATERSHED isn&rsquo;t
some magic silver bullet that offers the latest in blady-da-blah blogging,
or oh-so-cute video, although we know more about the latest and most
effective technologies than those who so casually throw those terms around.
</p>

<p>
WHAT WATERHED IS ... We&rsquo;re a consulting company made up of very experienced,
successful folks who understand the power of the internet AND integrated
fundraising and advocacy, and are, well, a little fed up with all the
un-tested myths and nonsense that pass for &ldquo;insight&rdquo; and &ldquo;expertise&rdquo; in the
online world.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, we've done more than just shake our heads and complain.
Instead, we've gathered the best and the brightest from online and offline
marketing and organizing and pulled together a pretty kickass team.
</p>

<p>
And, we&rsquo;ve put all the skills of these great virtuosos under the baton of
Madeline Stanionis, one of the most experienced online fundraising,
advocacy, and marketing experts in the country. From her stint as President
and Creative Director at Donordigital, she brings a string of real successes
from Amnesty International to CARE to Human Rights Campaign to NARAL
Pro-Choice America, and dozens of groups across the alphabet. Not to mention
her breakthrough book on online fundraising, The Mercifully Brief Real World
Guide to Raising Thousands of Dollars with Email.
</p>

<p>
The result? Well, frankly, results.
</p>

<p>
Results from our specially tailored online fundraising, advocacy and donor
loyalty campaigns, custom-designed for you. Watershed works with you to
develop:
</p>

<p>
&middot;      Online strategies
&middot;      Engaged online constituents
&middot;      Advocacy campaigns
&middot;      Comprehensive online fundraising
&middot;      Cultivation, viral, and communication programs
&middot;      Social networking know-how
&middot;      Hands-on, day-to-day management
&middot;      Results-oriented planning and evaluation
</p>

<p>
To better understand how we can help you be successful online, give us a
call at (888) 516-8580 or send us an email at
breakthrough@watershedcompany.com.
</p>

<p>
One more thing: Yes, we&rsquo;re hiring. If you like the idea of working with a
smart, dedicated, creative, and fun team to help build the company you
always wanted to work for, then send your resume and cover letter to
kickassjobs@watershedcompany.com.
