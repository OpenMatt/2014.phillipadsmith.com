  via <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com\">CrunchBase</a>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\nThis
  weekend, I decided I wanted to finally order a copy of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.beyondtheecho.net/\">Beyond
  The Echo Chamber</a>. Unfortunately, the book's publisher doesn't offer direct shipping
  to Canada, so -- after chatting with one of the authors -- I was directed to <a
  href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Echo-Chamber-Networked-Progressive/dp/1595584714\">Amazon</a>.
  Don't get me wrong: I use Amazon quite a bit. However, when buying a book from a
  smaller or progressive press -- like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thenewpress.com\">The
  New Press</a> -- I try to go direct, or get it from a smaller distributor. Don't
  ask me why, I just do. (Probably some incorrect assumption that more of the proceeds
  will get to the author or some-such lefty nonsense.)\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe
  side effect of ordering from Amazon is that I over-order. You see, the shipping
  on sending one book to Canada is high enough to encourage me to get five or six
  books instead, thus distributing the cost of shipping across more goods (in theory,
  anyway). That's all fine, as the Amazon shopping experience is a lovely one and
  I can read all those handy reviews and so on.&nbsp;\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt wasn't until Sunday, however, that I realized
  that Amazon's real competitive advantage is <b>not</b> their shopping experience.
  It is, in fact, their <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service\"
  title=\"Customer service\" rel=\"wikipedia\">customer service</a> experience. No
  doubt you all have stories of your own, but here's how mine goes:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</div>\r\n<blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0
  0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\">\r\n\tAs I finished my order, I remembered
  that I had purchased Amazon Prime long ago and that -- because of its US-only shipping
  policy -- I had never used it. Now, Amazon prime was about $75 USD and was supposed
  to offer very low, or free, shipping in exchange for that annual fee. However, I
  had missed the rather fine print at the time of purchasing Prime and had, subsequently,
  never used it. It had long expired, in fact.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tNonetheless, I thought: what the heck, I'm here on the
  site, I'll send a message about it. So I did, and it was roughly:\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br
  />\r\n</div>\r\n<blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0
  0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;\">\r\n\t<i>Some time ago, I purchased Amazon
  Prime at the suggestion of the site. However, I was not able to use it as I do not
  reside in the US and rarely send things to people in the US. I don't feel that the
  US-only shipping condition of the Prime service is well presented. So, in the interest
  of future customers, you may want to make that a bit more clear. I'm not formally
  asking for a refund, but just wanted to make you aware of my experience.</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i><span
  class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">It was probably a bit longer,
  but that's roughly what I said. The next day -- a Sunday, no less -- I had this
