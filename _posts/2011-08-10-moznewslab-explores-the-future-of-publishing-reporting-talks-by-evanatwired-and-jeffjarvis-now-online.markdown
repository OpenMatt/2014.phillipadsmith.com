One week ago today, the final lecture in the [#MozNewsLab](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/content/full-description/) series was delivered by none other than [Jeff Jarvis](https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis), author of [What Would Google Do](http://www.amazon.com/What-Would-Google-Jeff-Jarvis/dp/0061709719), respected media critic, and Director of the new [Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism](http://towknight.com/) in [The City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism](http://www.journalism.cuny.edu/).

Two days earlier, #MozNewsLab participants heard from [Evan Hansen](http://twitter.com/evanatwired), Editor In Chief of [Wired.com](http://wired.com).

From metrics and mobile, to the link economy and rapidly changing "atomic parts" of journalism, nothing less than the future of news and publishing itself was the focus of the fourth and final week in the lab.

In the immortal words of Internet publishing guru [Gary Vaynerchuk](http://crushitbook.com/): They **crushed** it.

You can find Evan's talk [here](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/content/lecture-no-10-evan-hansen-editor-in-chief-of-wiredcom/) and you can find Jeff's [here](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/content/lecture-no-11-final-lecture-w-jeff-jarvis-author-of-what-would-google-do/).

Sadly, with those two talks delivered, the organized parts of #MozNewsLab are starting to wind down.

Fear not, followers, there's still lots of activity on [Planet MozNewsLab](http://planet.drumbeat.org/moznewslab).

And, after the last handful of the final projects have arrived, we'll be posting a gallery of final projects by the lab participants.

In the meantime, here are three great posts about #MozNewsLab:
