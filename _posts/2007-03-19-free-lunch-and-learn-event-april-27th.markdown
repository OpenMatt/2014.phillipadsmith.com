		The first session in the series &mdash; <b>E-commerce: stores, donations, and registrations </b>&mdash; will be a fast-and-furious exploration of the options for Canadian organizations that want to accept payments online. Whether it&rsquo;s as simple as a basic event registration, as critical as a monthly donation, or putting your entire catalogue operation online &hellip; you leave having learned something new, and have a sense of where to go next.
