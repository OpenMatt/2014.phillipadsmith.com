<p>Two exciting and not-to-be-missed events are approaching in June: <a href="http://www.marsdd.com/socialtechtraining">Social Tech Training</a> and <a href="http://www.magazinescanada.ca/magnet/english/">MagNet</a>. </p>

<p>The first -- from the people behind <a href="http://www.webofchange.org">Web of Change</a> -- is Toronto's very first Social Tech Training at MaRS.<!--break--></p>

<p>From the event Web site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We've gathered the best and the brightest leaders in this sector, and we've put together an agenda that will help take your organization to the next level. Each participant will emerge with new technical, creative, and leadership skills, a powerful network, and a customized, comprehensive “Web 2.0 Plan” for their organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://importantprojects.co.uk/">Rob Purdie</a> and I are both on the faculty for this event and we managed to <a href="http://importantprojects.com/archives/000135.php">meet up in London last week</a> to hammer out some session ideas, and to review the draft agenda. We're both pretty stoked to be party of what's sure to be the one of the most memorable training events of the summer. </p>

<p>And, just two weeks earlier, <a href="">Magazines Canada</a> is holding their annual <a href="http://www.magazinescanada.ca/magnet/english/">MagNet</a> conference. MagNet offers the forward-thinking magazine professional a phenomenal mix of seminars, round-tables, featured speakers and workshops designed to enlighten, provoke and inspire.</p>

<p>This year I'll be delivering a session for small magazines on "<a href="http://www.magazinescanada.ca/magnet/english/session_info.php?id=86&amp;cat=7">Website Makeovers Made Easy</a>" on Wednesday, June 4th, at 10:15 AM. </p>

<p>With two to choose from, you have no excuses! Register early. </p>
