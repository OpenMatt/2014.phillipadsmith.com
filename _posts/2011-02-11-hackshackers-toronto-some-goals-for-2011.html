<p>After just a few short months, the <a href="http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/">Toronto chapter of Hacks/Hackers</a> feels like it's hitting a good stride. My comrades in off-the-side-of-the-desk co-organizing -- <a href="http://twitter.com/kimfox">Kim Fox</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/craigsilverman">Craig Silverman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Ivor Tossell</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ivortossell">Mason Wright</a> -- have been instrumental in kicking this group into shape, and forging a pretty compelling vision for what's to come.</p>

<p>Early in the new year, we got together at <a href="http://www.barwellington.ca/">Bar Wellington</a> and hammered out a simple plan over sandwiches, salads, and coffee: </p>

<ul>
<li>The events are going to be short-and-sweet and journalism-focused;</li>
<li>Each event and will aim leave folks with both practical tips and envelope-pushing ideas to take back to their reporting, or hacking; </li>
<li>A news event (hopefully recent) will be unpacked, we'll hear about how it was produced, technically and editorially;</li>
<li>There will be a hands-on technology demo;</li>
<li>There will be an exploration of what the future holds, e.g., new formats for digital storytelling</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the broad strokes. We'll be playing with the event format -- some talks, some Q&amp;A, etc. -- but the focus will stay fairly consistent. We'll see what works and what doesn't and iterate toward something awesome.</p>

<p>This will happen every six weeks starting February 15th. <a href="http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/">Events are already scheduled for March and May</a>.</p>

<p>When Mason and I went for a beer back in October to discuss starting Hacks/Hackers Toronto, I didn't have a well-formed theory of change about why Toronto might need such a thing. Put simply: after attending one of the first meetings of Hacks/Hackers Boston in June, and subsequently meeting <a href="http://twitter.com/richgordon">Rich Gordon</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/burtherman">Burt Herman</a> in Chicago at the <a href="http://hackshackers.com/2010/10/12/riotstartr-wins-grand-prize-at-independent-media-mobile-hackathon/">Mobile Hack</a> event, I was convinced that this movement was something worth supporting, but -- beyond that -- it was just a hunch. </p>

<p>After two successful meet-ups and lots of one-on-one conversations, things are a bit clearer. <b>For journalist</b>, it is an opportunity to find the language, the tools &amp; skills, and the collaborators necessary to continue to evolve their craft. <b>For local hardware hackers and software programmers</b>, it's an opportunity to get a look "inside the tent" of the news-production machine, and to understand the role it plays in helping people understand what's going on around them. Collectively, it's a space to learn, share, and experiment.</p>

<p>I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some interesting collaborations spring up here in Toronto. We're going to do our best to create a friendly environment for them to take root. </p>

<p><br /></p><p><i>P.S. We are searching for a semi-permanent home for the events (or a small stable of locations). If you have any ideas, or would like to offer your space, please drop me a line.</i></p>
