  <p>Okay, maybe stopping greedy capitalism cold is a bit ambitious. But I'm hoping you can spare some time this week to help one of the world's most recognized social justice publications (outside of the US!) reinvent itself online.</p>

  <p>If you're reading this blog, you're probably one of the "smartest people in the room," as far as I'm concerned (<em>cough</em>) and New Internationalist needs all the (free) help it can get to save the world from greedy capitalists.</p>

  <p>In pursuit of the Wisdom of Crowds, and similar bottom-up ideas that are redefining how people approach networks, events, campaigns and democracy, New Internationalist is opening the redesign process up to readers, supporters, enthusiasts and -- I hope -- smart people just like you.</p>

  <p>I'll cut to the chase. The brave person leading the design -- CSS evangelist Andy Clarke -- is blogging the entire process and I'd be forever indebted if you could check out some of his recent posts and provide thoughtful and critical feedback.</p>
