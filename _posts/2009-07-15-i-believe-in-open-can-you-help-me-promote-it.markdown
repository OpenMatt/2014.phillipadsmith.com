<p>I passionately believe in Open, but I need your help to sell my case to the rest of the New Internationalist co-operative.

  <p>About a month ago, the editors <a href="http://blog.newint.org/editors/2009/04/23/magazine-suggestions/">posted to the NI blog asking for input on this year's issues</a>. There were lots of great ideas posted, and many more e-mailed in, and many that are surely circulating within the co-op itself. But <strong>I believe in Open</strong>, and I feel passionately that the talented editors at New Internationalist would be able to do the subject justice (social justice, that is). And I want to see the ideas of &quot;Open,&quot; reach the hundreds of thousands of people that read New Internationalist in print, and online.</p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, I've left it to the last possible minute to prepare a proposal on what I'm calling &quot;<strong>The Open Issue</strong>.&quot; The Open Issue would expose readers to the ecosystem of interconnected movements that share an ethos of &quot;openness.&quot; It would explore what has become a global movement to make better software, knowledge, education, citizens, and -- at some level -- society. The annual meeting starts <em>this</em> Thursday, and I need your help to get the proposal in tip-top shape before then. </p> 
  <p>The challenge is simple: Deliver a 1-page, preferably shorter, proposal by Thursday.</p> 
  <p>The proposal should:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Explain the concepts: free and open-source software, and open knowledge, politics, medicine and so on;</li> 
    <li>Demonstrate the importance: Speak to how these movements are impacting society (both positively, and negatively) and what the future might hold;</li> 
    <li>Provide some examples: And, most importantly, demonstrate how these movements are connected to the concerns of those in the Majority World. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Help me explain these concepts -- from local to global; from grasstops to the grassroots -- and, more importantly, help me distill them down. What started as a short proposal has grown (literally overnight) into something of an essay. </p> 
  <p>So, in the spirit of openness, I thought I would post the proposal online so that you can help me distill a broad concept into one single page. You'll find the full text of the proposal <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddfx3g3n_59xd99m3fh">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Feel free to:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Post your thoughts and comments below;</li> 
    <li>Or -- if you have a Google account -- you can edit the document directly, using <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddfx3g3n_59xd99m3fh&amp;invite=352639388">this link</a>;</li> 
    <li>Alternately, you can make a copy and send me your edits. (E-mail them to <em>my first name</em> at newint dot org.)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>When you're reading it, maybe you could keep these questions in mind:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>What are significant areas of activity or movement that I've missed, or could expand on? </li> 
    <li>What's just babble and can be removed entirely? </li> 
    <li>What is vibrant and alive in the Majority World &quot;open&quot; movement that could be highlighted? Or what will have the most impact on the Majority World going forward? </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Look forward to your helpful comments, ideas, and edits.</p> 
  <p><strong>[UPDATE: Many thanks to feedback from several of you, I've been able to submit a fairly solid preliminary version to the co-op (as long as they make an exception for it being so late!). Pleases keep the input coming!]</strong></p>
