    <p>Call me a curmudgeon (and many do), but I just can't understand why intelligent folks make the choice to completely ignore Perl. I can understand if you don't want to use it yourself -- that's all cool -- but I wish folks would at least give it the nod it deserves. </p> 
  <p>Case in point: I was reading <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">Simon Wilson's excellent blog post about Node.js</a> -- an &quot;evented I/O for V8 javascript&#8221; and was surprised that he <em>only</em> referenced Twisted (Python) and EventMachine (Ruby) when talking about non-blocking event-driven frameworks.</p> 
  <p>Why no mention of Perl?</p>
