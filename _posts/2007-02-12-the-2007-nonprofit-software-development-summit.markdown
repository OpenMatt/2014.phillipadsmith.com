title: The 2007 Nonprofit Software Development Summit
date: '2007-02-12 15:40:24 -0600'
excerpt: |-
  <p>I'm pretty sad to be missing <em>another</em> fantastic event hosted by <a href="http://www.aspirationtech.org">Aspiration</a>. <a href="http://www.aspirationtech.org/about/people">Gunner</a> almost managed to get me there with a few well-timed bribes -- but, alas, the timing is a bit off. If you're involved in supporting non-profits and their technology needs, and want to be involved in some of the most important "social tech" conversations this year, consider attending this event (and take good notes for me!): </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Summit will be a first-of-its-kind convening to bring together the range of developers, technologists, managers, eRiders, integrators, users and others who self-identify under the umbrella of “nonprofit software development”. The event will provide an opportunity both to gather as a community and to take stock of the field, while building connections and capacity.</p>
