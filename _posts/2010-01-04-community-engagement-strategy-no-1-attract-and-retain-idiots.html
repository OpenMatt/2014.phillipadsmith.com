<p>If you run an open-source project, or a community project of any nature -- where you're seeking to engage a range of people to volunteer in different roles -- you should start your week off with this <a href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/love-your-idiots/">humorous, yet insightful, piece</a> by the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mstrout/">uber-prolific Matt Trout</a>. </p>

<p>Key takeaways are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can attract and retain idiots as community members ... they can already speak fluent idiot and can help the next one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the critically important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Idiot" is usually just a short form of "person I can't yet communicate with". Which means they probably think you're an idiot, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
