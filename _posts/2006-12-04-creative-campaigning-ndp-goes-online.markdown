excerpt: "<p><img src=\"http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/files/ndp-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mission
  accomplished\" /></p>\n\n<p>I received the following (cleverly crafted) e-mail from
  the <a href=\"http://www.ndp.ca\">NDP</a> team on Saturday:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n
  \ <p>Can you believe these Liberals?</p>\n  \n  <p>Watching the Liberal convention,
  it's clear these Liberals haven't learned a thing. Arrogance and backroom deals
  are alive and well in the Liberal party. </p>\n  \n  <p>On a better note, we've
  almost succeeded in our campaign to buy an ad on theglobeandmail.com.  We just need
  about $2000 more to make it a go. Can I count on you to make it happen?  Please
  donate online now by clicking here.</p>\n  \n  <p>When people log on to theglobeandmail.com
  on Monday, let's make Jack Layton and the NDP the first thing they see.</p>\n  \n
  \ <p>Éric Hébert-Daly\n  Federal Secretary, Canada's NDP\n  Sent from my BlackBerry
  Wireless Handheld</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And, upon visiting the <a href=\"http://theglobeandmail.com\">theglobeandmail.com</a>
  this morning, found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_layton\">Jack Layton</a>
  staring me right in the face. I've screen captured the page for posterity: a nice
  example of very solid online campaign strategy.</p>"
