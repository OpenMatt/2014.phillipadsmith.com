    <p>Over the years, I've been involved with a fair number of Bricolage implementations for different organizations. (For those that don't know, <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org">Bricolage is a large, Perl-based, publishing system</a>.) Many of these organizations don't have a full-time Perl programmer on staff, and instead rely on external contracts to do the heavy lifting that comes up from time-to-time. However, most of these organizations have a &quot;Web producer&quot; or &quot;Web manager&quot; -- a generalist who helps with content updates, and smaller scale Web site changes -- and, almost without fail, that person eventually asks: <em>How can I learn more about Perl?</em></p>
