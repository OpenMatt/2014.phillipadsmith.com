title: Free wireless is good for small businesses

excerpt: "<p>This report-back from a <a href=\"http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/\">St.
  Lawrence Market</a> merchant caught my eye today on the <a href=\"http://wirelesstoronto.ca\">Wireless
  Toronto</a> mailing list:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just a quick update, using Pay-Pal
  and Wireless Toronto combined has had\n  a dramatic effect on my sales. Other merchants
  are dropping by and\n  asking how it works. One is purchasing a macbook on Friday
  and has set up the same type of\n  account.</p>\n  \n  <p>Also I had a visit from
  a  banker out of Unionville, I think it may prompt some Canadian banks to examine
  more closely their small business practices and procedures.</p>\n  \n  <p>All in
  all so far a positive experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's great to see efforts
  like <a href=\"http://wirelesstoronto.ca/october7/\">setting up free wireless in
  the St. Lawrence Market</a> having a real impact. Yet another reason why free municipal
  wireless is a good thing (especially when supported by volunteer-run groups like
  <a href=\"http://www.wirelesstoronto.ca\">Wireless Toronto</a>. </p>"
