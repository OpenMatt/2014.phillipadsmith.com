Your submissions to the CRTC will be considered in the "traffic
management" hearings held later this year. Please take a few
seconds to send your comments to the CRTC before the February
16th deadline: <a href="http://www.unionvoice.org/ct/n7qAbqF1iPFM/">http://www.unionvoice.org/ct/n7qAbqF1iPFM/</a>
</p>

<p>
We must convince the CRTC to stop big telecoms from controlling
our access to the Internet. Bell, Rogers and other large ISPs
cannot be allowed to continue serving their own interests by
"throttling" Internet traffic.
</p>

<p>
The decisions made by the CRTC will signal Canada's digital
destiny. Your submission could make the difference in whether we
have a closed gatekeeper Internet or open online access and
innovation.
</p>

<p>
Remember that you must make your submission before Feb. 16.
Please take a few seconds to tell the CRTC that you alone should
control your Internet surfing.

<p>
We've come this far; it's time to stop Internet throttling for
good!
