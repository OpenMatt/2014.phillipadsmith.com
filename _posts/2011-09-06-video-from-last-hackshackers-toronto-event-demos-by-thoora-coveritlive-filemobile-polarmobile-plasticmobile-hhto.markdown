Just a couple of days before I hit the road for Georgian Bay last month (for some much-needed hangout time with friends), with the huge help of [my comrades in hacker-journalism arms](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/members/?op=leaders), we managed to organize a darn-fine little [Hacks/Hackers Toronto event](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/events/18869571/).

Stealing more than a bit of inspiration from the ever-awesome [David Crow](https://twitter.com/#!/davidcrow) and his marry band of [DemoCampsters](http://democamp.com/), we adjusted the evening's format to be more casual than our usual [#hhto](https://twitter.com/search#hhto) events, and -- instead -- asked five local software companies to come out and run the gauntlet of a six-minute demo.

Fueled by Steamwhistle and a roaring crowd, these folks completely crushed it. Almost each of them finished _before_ the bell rang. Probably a first in the history of a #hhto event.

A big thanks to the fine people at the rather fabulous [Workplace One](http://www.workplaceone.ca/) for hosting the event.

For those of you that weren't able to attend, I managed to capture videos of each of the demos. Enjoy! (And plan on coming out to the [next event](http://meetupto.hackshackers.com/events/20238921/), which is likely to happen at the new Mozilla HQ in Toronto.)
