 <p><a href="https://gcrc.carleton.ca/confluence/display/GCRCWEB/Lauriault">Tracey P. Lauriault</a> announces a great looking event for data activists, designers, and citizens in Ottawa next month: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a Hackfest planned in Ottawa on April 24. A beautiful web presence has been created (<a href="http://opendataottawa.ca/">http://opendataottawa.ca</a>) and a wiki is filling up with ideas.  </p>
  
  <p>The invite goes out to:
  Developers
  Designers
  Librarians
  Statisticians
  Citizens
  This is a wonderful opportunity to apply ones professional skills as a citizen to build something together!</p>
  
  <p>There are also some Montrealers &amp; Torontonians who may want to come and show their wares and re-purpose them for the city of Ottawa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No agenda yet, but the <a href="http://opendataottawa.pbworks.com/Open-Data-Ottawa-App-Ideas">ideas page is looking good</a>. If you happen to attend, I might just see you there. </p>
