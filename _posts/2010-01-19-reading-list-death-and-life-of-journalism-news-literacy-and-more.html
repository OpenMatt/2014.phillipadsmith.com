<p>Some great reading this week on the future of journalism.</p>
<p>First, Melanie forwarded me this <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0114/Want-better-journalism-Boost-news-literacy">excellent article</a> by Dean Miller on new literacy at the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0114/Want-better-journalism-Boost-news-literacy">Christian Science Monitor</a>. Fantastic read.
</p>
<p>Then Bob McChesney sent me a _personal_ note (har har) about his new book:</p>
<blockquote>
My new book, The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-American-Journalism-Revolution/dp/1568586051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1247782505&amp;sr=1-1">Death and Life of American Journalism</a>, which I wrote with my friend John Nichols, has just been published this last week by Nation Books. I think it is the best and most important book we have written, and of the utmost importance. It provides a comprehensive and original explanation of the current crisis in journalism, a critique of the current favored "solutions" to the crisis, and an argument for strong public subsidies to create a viable, independent news media. It is based on years of research, but has been written to address the deep crisis of the immediate moment and visible future. 
</blockquote>

<p>Per Bob's suggestion, you should be able to order it from a local bookstore (if there are any left in your town).</p>
<p>If you want a taste of what's in the book, see <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100125/nichols_mcchesney"> see this week's cover story in The Nation.</a> (another great read).</p>
<p>If you buy the book, let me know if I can borrow it when I'm back in Canada!</p>
