<p>Long-time "Bricoleur" Chris Schults reports that every Seattleite's favourite co-op, PCC Natural Markets (the largest consumer-owned natural food retail co-operative in the United States), has just re-launched their Web property using <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org">BricolageCMS</a> and <a href="http://www.drupal.or">Drupal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week PCC launched its redesigned website, which is a blend of Bricolage, Drupal and custom PHP.</p>
<p>So far, the response has been very positive, and I invite you to give the new site a whirl:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/">http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com</a>

<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Chris, if ever so briefly, while we were both working on a re-launch of online daily environmental news site <a href="http://www.grist.org">Grist.org</a> in 2004, which was re-built using <a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org">BricolageCMS</a> (now running Expression Engine, I believe). Five years later and Chris is the Bricolage expert -- I love it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, online daily news site <a href="http://www.thetyee.ca">TheTyee.ca</a> made a <a href="http://homeofficekernel.blogspot.com/2009/07/tyee-bricolage-and-drupal-integration.html">similar decision to use BricolageCMS and Drupal</a> when they upgraded their Web operation recently, and they've <a href="http://drupal.org/project/bricolage">contributed a model</a> to help folks make similar integrations.</p>
