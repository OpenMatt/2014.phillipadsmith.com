A great little <a href="http://enoramous.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/taddle-creeks-burly-online-presence/">review</a> of the <a href="http://taddlecreekmag.com">Taddle Creek Web site</a> that Conan and I produced over two and a half years ago. The site is a testament to Conan's always-crystal-clear vision, even though I did want to add in a search bar. Enjoy!&nbsp;
<div><blockquote><p><br /></p><p>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taddle_Creek_(magazine)">Wikipedia</a> has declared that <a href="http://www.taddlecreekmag.com/">Taddle Creek</a> magazine possesses "a robust on-line component." As a person who enjoys both the Internet and words that sound funny, I thought it would be interesting to examine what exactly makes Taddle Creek's website so robust.</p>
<p>One of the things contributing to Taddle Creek's mighty online brawn is its <a href="http://www.taddlecreekmag.com/archive">archive</a>, in which hundreds of articles, stories, and poems are freely accessible. There are two viewing options: alphabetically by author, or chronologically by issue. One can even download mp3s of every piece of writing in the Summer 2008 issue. I encourage you to check out Paul Bellini as the Voice of Taddle Creek in "Proper Capitalization."</p>
<p>Taddle Creek's overall vigour is enhanced by its hilarious <a href="http://www.taddlecreekmag.com/submit">submission guidelines</a>, which have an entire point devoted to making sure the magazine never receives another story "written from the point of view of a fetus." Slide shows, such as the one accompanying Conan Tobias's "<a href="http://www.taddlecreekmag.com/fake-authenticity">Fake Authenticity</a>," are a good example of sleek, thoughtful design.</p>
<p>Overall Taddle Creek's website is simple but thorough, with excellent back issue material. The site has a minimalist design concept, but there are sophisticated touches, like the slide shows. It could use a search bar, but apart from that, the site is easy to use, funny, and engaging. Well done, Taddle Creek. Well done."</p><p><br /></p><p>Original review is <a href="http://enoramous.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/taddle-creeks-burly-online-presence/">here</a>.</p>
