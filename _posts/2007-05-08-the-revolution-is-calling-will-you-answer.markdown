<p>But May 1st, 2007 wasn't just about an international day of solidarity with workers...</p>

" align="left" />Last week our friends at <a href="http://www.telekommunisten.net/">Telekommunisten</a> -- a 100% worker-owned telecommunications company -- also announced the launch of their newest product called <a href="http://www.telekommunisten.net/Dialstation-en">Dialstation</a>. Dialstation is an incredibly innovative way to make international calls from a mobile telephone; and it works with any normal telephone and doesn't require any special software. Basically, Dialstation is a prepaid calling service designed to be used from your mobile phone. You can make a call by sending an SMS, calling the mail Dailstation number or by using a unique "Personal Direct Number". From that point, the call is connected using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VOIP</a> technology, which makes the rates to many countries, such as China,
Argentina, Venezuela, Australia, the USA and Canada very inexpensive.</p>

<p>I had a chance to trial Dialstation while Melanie and I were visiting Berlin in December. I have to admit: it really is "revolutionary" technology. And, on more than one occasion this last week (while I was visiting Cuba), I wished that I could remember my Dialstation number! (I'm dreading that next mobile phone bill.)</p>

" align="right" />As if that wasn't enough revolution in my inbox for one day, once I found my way to one of the few wireless Internet hotspots in Havana (which is located in the Hotel Saratoga) I found the <a href="http://www.exacteditions.com/shop/386/422">latest digital edition of New Internationalist</a> waiting for me. This isn't just <em>any</em> issue of NI, <strong>it's the 400th issue!</strong> The issue -- called "Daring to dream: Inspiration from the Majority World" -- was put together by the ever-talented Dinyar Godrej and contains an incredible collection of articles devoted to ideas and activism, and a special feature on Palestine.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the date of NI's inception, I realized that we're the same age -- so it should come as no surprise that the magazine has been a constant theme in my life. First as part of an assignment in high-school, then again as inspiration during my early days as a photographer, and now as a client of Community Bandwidth. And, when I mentioned that I was heading down to Havana, NI editor Wayne Ellwood handed me a copy of his <a href="http://www.newint.org/issue301/contents.html">1998 issue on Cuba </a> that was as valuable a resource for me as anything that I read before going. And, as Wayne predicted, not much has changed since he was there over 9 years ago. </p>

<p>Anyway, enough reminiscing about May 1st: the phone is ringing...  ;-)</p>
