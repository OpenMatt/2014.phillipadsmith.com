<p>Decent <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/22/dash.twitter.shutdown/">editorial by Anil Dash</a> on keeping data "loosely coupled" to the dominant social networks of the day:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Anil Dash says people don't have to rely just on Twitter, Google and Facebook to relay information.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It picks up on a lot of what <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/12/whyItsTimeToBreakOutOfTwit.html">Dave Winer</a> has been saying, and dovetails with <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2010/01/one-more-reason-to-think-twice-about-hosted-services.shtml">my own rants</a> on the state of "free" online services.
</p>
<p>Feels like there's some pretty solid consensus on the matter. Hoping to see some interesting innovations in this space shortly.
