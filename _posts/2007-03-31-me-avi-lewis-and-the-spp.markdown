excerpt: |-
  <p>My partner Melanie and I are in <a href="http://www.ottawa.ca/">Ottawa</a>. It's getting late. And I'm still preparing for the <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/workshops/outreach.html">workshop that I'm leading tomorrow with Meera Karunanathan</a> from the <a href="http://www.canadians.org">Council of Canadians</a>. (I know, I know: don't leave everything for the last minute!) The Council (along with the Canadian Labour Congress, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, and others) have organized a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach-in">teach-in</a> that promises to be nothing less than historic. </p>

  <p>Apparently I'm not the only one up late. My search for a little music to keep me company turned up no less than the personal music library of <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/Avi_Lewis.html">Avi Lewis</a>. I feel like I'm in good company tonight.</p>

  <p>Avi will kick-off tomorrow's <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/">Integrate This</a> teach-in as moderator for "The Big Business of Insecurity," "Commandeering the Continent: Military Integration, Big Oil and the Environment," and "The Democratic Deficit: Parliament and the SPP." <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/Judy_Rebick.html">Judy Rebick</a> takes over in the afternoon moderating the session "The North America We Really Want." </p>

  <p>A who's who of the social-justice movement here in Canada, other names on the line-up include: <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/Maude_Barlow.html">Maude Barlow</a>, <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/Elizabeth_May.html">Elizabeth May</a>, and <a href="http://www.canadians.org/integratethis/Maureen_Webb.html">Maureen Webb</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm pretty excited to be here, and to have an opportunity to present some online campaigning strategies to activists from across the country. Heck, it'll even be a great opportunity to update <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phillipadsmith/">my Flickr feed</a>.</p>
