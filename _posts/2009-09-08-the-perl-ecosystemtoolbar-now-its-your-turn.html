	A couple weeks back, I asked the question &quot;<a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/08/20/the-big-explore-perl-button/">Where is the big 'Explore Perl' button?</a>&quot; and followed up last week <a href="http://blog.newint.org/tech/2009/08/31/the-perl-ecosystem/">with a short demo</a> of the kind of thing I was thinking about. Some folks liked it: so today it's one step closer to &quot;reality.&quot; And now it's your turn to take it to the next level. </p>

	After Adam mentioned that he was <a href="http://ali.as/top100/">running a humourous mock-up</a> of the &quot;Perl Ecosystem Toolbar&quot; on the <a href="http://ali.as/top100/">CPAN Top 100 site</a>, I thought &quot;crap, I better see if I can actually make this thing work.&quot;
