It's been five years since I attended the [Online News Association](http://ournalists.org/) annual conference in Toronto. It was a great event, but I never made it back. So, I'm kinda' excited to be heading to Boston next week for [ONA 11](http://ona11.journalists.org/).

Instead of my usual last-minute ad-hoc session selection, classically done during the first session of the conference, I thought I'd grab a cup of the good stuff and get ahead of the curve. 

Here are my picks, minus the keynotes, lunches, and whatnot: 

### Thursday, September 22 (pre-conference day)

1. Obviously, I'm a bit partial to the super-awesome all-day [Hacks/Hackers Hacking @ ONA11 ](http://ona11.sched.org/event/ad40450f70ecb2f7e318307c8d6c1a29) event, because [I'm helping to organize it](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/09/going-to-onaconf-this-month-live-near-boston-come-to-the-hackshackers-hack-day-on-sept-22.html). Why don't you come and build something too?  :)

1. If I wasn't helping with the hack day, I'd most certainly check out [News Entrepreneuring 3.0](http://ona11.sched.org/event/28208f01c98482e75136db71d4edceff) with Jan Schaffer, Scott Rosenberg, and many other news start-up celebs. 

### Friday, September 23 (the main show)

1. [You Can't Duck the Math: Entrepreneurial Journalism](http://ona11.sched.org/event/705c750d3a5e9c8dcc28766d80813e94) with folks from UMass Amherst and CUNY journalism programs.

1. [New Platforms for Long-Form Journalism](http://ona11.sched.org/event/a0d498da0322bbf4962256dce53a168a) with Nieman Journalism Lab, The Atavist, and Longreads.

1. [The Brand Is Dead; Long Live the Brand!](http://ona11.sched.org/event/c8430261c4af8fe8dc29d73f9a3bb849) with Meghan Garber and Matt Thompson.

1. [Making It Work with a Small Staff](http://ona11.sched.org/event/170bd72358c70a806a878729b2d63285) with the folks from Technically Philly (who put on [BarCamp News Innovation](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/05/link-love-from-barcamp-news-innovation-philly-bcniphilly.html)) and Oakland Local.

### Saturday, September 24

1. [Google News and Newsrooms](http://ona11.sched.org/event/d414397a77bfc1bdcc0c64830ae5df3d) with folks from, well, Google. Interested to get the inside scoop on getting inside Google News.

1. [SMO Is the New SEO](http://ona11.sched.org/event/82d4cf9b445173dffd797efe9943b6a5) with folks from Yahoo! and Mashable. Kinda' unsure about this one... might check out the unconference session instead.

1. Last but not least, you'll find me at the [Media, Freedom, and the Web: Lunch with the Knight Foundation and Mozilla](http://ona11.sched.org/event/e84a526dd85ff98b311f30d0ed549283) lunch session with Jose Zamora and Dan Sinker (and you should be too!).

After lunch, I'll need to run to the airport to catch a flight to Berlin for the first Knight-Mozilla "[Hacktoberfest](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/MoJo/hackfest/berlin)" -- a week-long building and making sprint with twenty of the [#MozNewsLab](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/learninglab/) graduates, and representatives from each of our news partners, Al Jazeera English, BBC, Boston.com, Guardian UK, and Zeit Online.

If I were sticking around, I'd probably check out:

1. [One Size Fits All: Responsive Web Design](http://ona11.sched.org/event/7efa9226b61be3eb4a8a936df2d1abf4) because I'm working on a responsive project for [The Tyee](http://thetyee.ca) right now.

1. [ 'If I Were in Charge, I'd _____'](http://ona11.sched.org/event/e7d211e7ffd82becbaf2f3f0f7a9c437) because I'd love to hear more about what these folks would change.


I think you should be able to see my picks [here](http://ona11.sched.org/phillipadsmith). If you're going to ONA 11 too, I'd be interested to see what sessions you're excited to attend. Drop your link in the comments whydontcha'?
