  <p><em>Perl hacker Phillip Smith taunted us about the lack of Perl support; but more than our investor&#8217;s money, the real keys to the Perl stack have been the very insightful feedback and ideas of another major contributor to the Perl community: Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.</em></p>

<p>Sometime last week, while I was basking in the glory of my thirty-eight birthday, I got the best birthday present ever. &#8220;A beta account on dotCloud to try out their new Perl support,&#8221; you ask? <em>Nope</em>. The real gift was getting called a &#8216;Perl hacker&#8217; in the same sentence as Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, a lot happened in the last week, and I was too busy slacking off to catch it until now.</p>

<p>For starters, dotCloud <a href="http://blog.dotcloud.com/dotcloud-introduces-camel-as-a-service-with-i">announced support for Perl</a> (also on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2491725">HackerNews</a>) on their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> platform (thanks, Miyagawa! And, <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/joining-dotcloud.html">congrats</a> on the new gig!). This is great news, and the Perl community has been quick to kick the tires; real Perl hackers have already tested several Web application frameworks on dotCloud:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.kraih.com/mojolicious-in-the-cloud-hello-dotcloud">Mojolicious in the cloud: Hello DotCloud!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onionstand.blogspot.com/2011/04/catalyst-in-cloud.html">Catalyst in the Cloud</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/marco_fontani/2011/04/dancing-on-a-cloud-made-of-pearls.html">Dancing on a cloud made of pearls</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/solomonstre">Solomon Hykes</a>, a dotCloud developer, noticed the same thing and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2518526">mentioned it on HackerNews</a>.</p>

<p>It gets better, however.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Active State <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/06/activestate_cloud_foundry/">announced their own foray into the clould</a>, with the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/cloud">developer preview of Stackato</a> for Perl and Python. The Active State cloud is reportely built on top of <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">Cloud Foundry</a>, a VMware initiative that calls itself &#8220;world&#8217;s first <em>open</em> Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering.&#8221; (Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mystery Perl PaaS provider <a href="http://www.phenona.com/">Phenona</a> continues to push forward and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/phenona/status/64554955796774912">tweets</a> that they are starting to pick up the pace on getting beta invites out.</p>

<p>So, from zero-to-hero, Perl now has at least three PaaS providers to choose from. It&#8217;s a great day, and it is really quite amazing <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/phillip_smith/2011/03/ten-million-dollars-to-dotcloud-but-still-no-perl-support.html">how much can happen in a few, short, weeks</a>.</p>

<p>I guess I should get on with writing my next cranky post: this time about <a href="http://codemirror.net/">Perl support in CodeMirror</a>.</p>
