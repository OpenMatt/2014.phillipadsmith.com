We're just **one day away from the closing registration** for the [Hacks/Hackers hack day at the Online News Association conference](http://hackshackers.com/hacking-at-ona11/). If you're going to be in Boston on Thursday and have not registered for the hack day yet, let this be your final reminder to [go forth and register](http://hacks-hackers-hacking-at-ona11.eventbrite.com/) for what is sure to be one of the most exciting and wildly competitive events of the whole week.

Just to ratchet the spirit of competition up a few notches, we've confirmed an all-star cast of individuals who will be judging your work at the end of the day. The judging panel currently includes:

* [Beth Davidz](http://twitter.com/bethdavidz), AOL
* [Mark Coatney](http://twitter.com/mcoatney), Tumblr
* [Miranda Mulligan](http://twitter.com/mirandamulligan), Boston Globe
* [Kathryn Hurley](http://twitter.com/Kathryn_Hurley), Google
* [Tyson Evans](http://twitter.com/tysone), The New York Times

And, should your team find itself in one of the top spots, you'll also get a shout out at the [Knight-Mozilla keynote lunch](http://ona11.sched.org/event/e84a526dd85ff98b311f30d0ed549283) during the ONA conference on Saturday.

On top of great judges, and great exposure for your team, we've also rounded up some swag & prizes from Rovi, dotCloud, Github, Infochimps, and (of course!) Mozilla.

### All are welcome

Come on out and join other hacks and hackers for this exciting day of making and building. Don't hold back if you're a hack, not a hacker, as there will be lots to do throughout the day for people of every skill level. 

Go register now.

If that's not enough to entice you, here are just a few of the organizations that are registered to come:

* Thompson Reuters
* The New York Times
* Ottawa Citizen
* WNYC
* Scripps Howard
* MIT
* Tableau Software
* Harvard Press
* La Nacion
* Globalnews.ca
* And many, many more...

### Show us your APIs

What are your favourite APIs? Perhaps your organization has an API to offer to hack day participants? Perhaps you have your own toolbox of data feeds that you rely on every day? Either way, we're looking for your help to compile a list of news-focused APIs that hack day participants can use to rapidly prototype their ideas. 

We've started a [public Google Doc over here](http://ps.ht/nWmgGD). Feel free to add to it and we'll be circulating it on Thursday morning.

Hope to see you on Thursday. It's going to be #awesome.
