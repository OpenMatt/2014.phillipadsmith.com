It is e-mails like this (re-published with permission) from a recent [#MozNewsLab](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/learninglab/) participant that make it so hard to take time away from the work that I enjoy so much it hardly feels like work most days:

<blockquote>
<p>
Hi Phillip,
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to say thank you for organizing the class! It was an
incredible experience -- personally, educationally, and for
meeting like-minded folks.
</p>
<p>
I kind of expected the educational piece based on the roster,
and it definitely did not disappoint -- especially talks like Aza's an John
Ressig's, which turned out to be amazing and completely not what I
imagined them to be.
</p>
<p>
The group itself was super impressive. The depth of talent was just
jaw-dropping (for me, particularly on the visual design and video
end). Meeting up with Kabir in New York was also awesome!
</p>
<p>
The bit that I least expected, but that turned out to be the most
visceral and powerful was the personal. I've done media and
blogging when I was younger, but I didn't realize to what extent I've
become a business and numbers guy since! Putting myself out there on
the Internet, whether in writing or on video, was incredibly weird, if
not painful. "Who am I to mouth off on news and journalism in
public?" And, yet, at the end, no one laughed, no one thought I was a
blowhard for speaking out of turn. If anything, people kind of
appreciated it.
</p>
<p>
So, thank you for everything, especially for pushing me to sneak out
of my shell! Please don't hesitate to stop on by if you're ever in
New York!
</p>
<p>
All the very best wishes.
</p>

That said, I am happy to be taking some time away from e-mail, the computer, and so on.

Happy Summer!
