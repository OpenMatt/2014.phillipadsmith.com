<p>This just in from the fine folks at the <a href="http://www.neworganizing.com">New Organizing Institute</a>:
</p>

<blockquote> <p>Have you been doing some innovative organizing work lately that you'd like to share? Have you won an organizing fight that you're particularly proud of? Have you been debriefing your organizing work with your peers? Are you ready to connect with hundreds of other progressive organizers from across the country?
</p>
<p>
If so, you need to attend <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1095/t/9024/l/eng/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=54951">RootsCamp</a>!
</p>

<p>I've never <i>actually</i> managed to make it to a <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1095/t/9024/l/eng/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=54951">RootsCamp</a> -- and it looks like I won't make it this year either -- but, as usual, the 2010 program looks like a "must attend" opportunity people doing community organizing. (I've only heard great things from past participants.)</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1095/signUp.jsp?key=4712">scholarships for individuals</a> who may need help getting to the event.</p>
