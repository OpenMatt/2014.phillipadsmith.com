Half way through hammering out an e-mail to Noah Scalin -- the creative powerhouse behind <a href="http::/alrdesign.com/">Another Limited Rebellion Design</a> -- I stumbled on <a href="http://gelconference.com/videos/2009/noah_scalin/
">this video</a> where Noah talks about his experiences with the "<a href="http://skulladay.blogspot.com/">Skull-A-Day</a>" project at the <a href="http://gelconference.com/">Good Experience Live conference.</a>
</p>
<p>Here's the summary of his talk:</p>

<blockquote>To design a different skull every day for a year, it turns out, you need a little help from your friends - and some strangers, too. Noah Scalin talks about one of the boldest creative challenges you'll ever hear about.
</blockquote>
<p>
It's about 30 minutes long, and <a href="http://gelconference.com/videos/2009/noah_scalin/
">worth every minute</a> -- especially, if you're in the market for some Tuesday-morning creative inspiration. 
</p>
<p>I'm crossing my fingers that I'll get to collaborate with someone that creative this year.</p>
