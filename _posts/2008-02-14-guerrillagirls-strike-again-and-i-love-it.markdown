  <p>BROAD CONTEMPORARY ART MUSEUM  (BCAM)  97% WHITE AND 87% MALE</p>
  
  <p>The new Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) at LACMA was paid for with 50 million bucks from the munificent LA businessman and art collector Eli Broad. And the first show is a selection of art from his own private collection. How exciting!</p>
  
  <p>Wait a minute…. Broad, the philanthropist, claims that "public education is the key civil rights issue of the 21st century," but his art collection is a lesson in discrimination and exclusion. How can this exhibition be a legitimate survey of contemporary art with so few women and artists of color? Especially in Los Angeles! And at a public museum like LACMA!</p>
  
  <p>Here are the stats:</p>
  
  <p>BCAM, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at LACMA: 30 artists, 97% white, 87% male</p>
  
  <p>Broad Foundation collection: 194 artists, 96% white, 83% male</p>
  
  <p>Let’s put lots of letters on Eli’s desk! Use ours or write your own, then email Eli Broad curator@broadartfoundation.org <a href="ma&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#x6F;:c&#x75;&#x72;&#x61;t&#111;&#114;&#64;&#x62;&#114;&#x6F;&#x61;&#100;&#x61;&#114;&#x74;&#x66;&#x6F;&#117;&#110;&#x64;&#x61;&#116;i&#x6F;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#x67;">c&#x75;&#x72;&#x61;t&#111;&#114;&#64;&#x62;&#114;&#x6F;&#x61;&#100;&#x61;&#114;&#x74;&#x66;&#x6F;&#117;&#110;&#x64;&#x61;&#116;i&#x6F;&#x6E;&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#x67;</a> or snail mail Broad Art Foundation, 3355 Barnard Way, Santa Monica, Ca 90405</p>
