    <p>Giving credit where credit is due: The folks behind <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>, are leading by example when it comes to doing community engagement well. Twice now, folks from the Padre project have dropped me a note to ask about this or that, which is a great way to catch people's attention So, with such great outreach, I'd feel like a complete schmoe if I didn't at least give Padre a whirl. </p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, getting Padre running is currently pretty difficult -- I'd say a tad more difficult than installing <a href="http://brcioagecms.org/">Bricolage</a>, which has historically been a non-trivial exercise. No doubt the Padre install process is going to get a whack easier soon, given the <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/timeline">high number of commits</a> the project sees in a given week. </p>
