Still in post-holiday catch-up mode and stumbled on this <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-12-31-john-mackey-whole-foods-conscious-capitalism">thoughtful article</a> by Tom Philpot on the tension between capitalism and "conscious capitalism." The story plays out at everyone's favourite "do no evil" grocery chain, <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Paycheck</a>. I'll be interested to see the changes at Whole Foods <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-12-31-john-mackey-whole-foods-conscious-capitalism">as the founder steps down as chairman of their board of directors</a> -- another item for my "When in North America" to-do list.
