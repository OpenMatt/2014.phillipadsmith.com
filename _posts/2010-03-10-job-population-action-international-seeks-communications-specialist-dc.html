<p>Second in the jobs with meaning smorgasborg is a position with <a href="http://www.populationaction.org/">Population Action International</a>. Here's the low-down on what they are looking for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Communications Specialist is being sought by Population Action International (PAI),  a not for profit organization working to improve individual well-being and preserve global resources by mobilizing political and financial support for population, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning" title="Family planning" rel="wikipedia">family planning</a> and <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_health" title="Reproductive health" rel="wikipedia">reproductive health</a> policies and programs.  PAI strives to create a world in which every person has a right and access to sexual and reproductive health, humanity and the natural environment exist in balance, and fewer people live in poverty.</p>
  
  <p>The position has two main areas of focus: media relations and new media outreach. The candidate will play a key role in strengthening PAI's messages and marketing its research reports and advocacy campaigns to target audiences.  This position will be part of a four to five person Communications team, reporting to the Vice President of Communications.</p>
</blockquote>
