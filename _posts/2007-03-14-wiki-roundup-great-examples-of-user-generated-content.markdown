  <p>It's <a href="http://www.wikinomics.com">no secret</a> that the software known as a Wiki has managed to change the world. The obvious examples like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> have shown that it is possible to hand over editing power to distributed teams of researchers, editors, and "<a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?wiki_gardening_tips">gardeners</a>" -- but can any organization leverage this approach? Maybe. </p>

  <p>Many of the organizations that I work with have asked about the potential of using a Wiki as part of their technology strategy, and eventually they ask for some good examples -- not quite at the Wikipedia scale -- that they can use to sell the idea to their co-workers. So, having answered that question a few times now, I thought I'd just do a short run-down here and -- hopefully -- keep it updated (with your help!). </p>

<p>It's <a href="http://www.wikinomics.com">no secret</a> that the software known as a Wiki has managed to change the world. The obvious examples like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> have shown that it is possible to hand over editing power to distributed teams of researchers, editors, and "<a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?wiki_gardening_tips">gardeners</a>" -- but can any organization leverage this approach? Maybe. </p>

<p>Many of the organizations that I work with have asked about the potential of using a Wiki as part of their technology strategy, and eventually they ask for some good examples -- not quite at the Wikipedia scale -- that they can use to sell the idea to their co-workers. So, having answered that question a few times now, I thought I'd just do a short run-down here and -- hopefully -- keep it updated (with your help!). </p>

<p>Keep in mind, these examples (and the ones I'm interested in) focus on: positive social impact, non-commercial activities, community engagement, a user-friendly interface, and a critical mass of entries.</p>

<p>So, here we go:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch">SourceWatch</a>: A collaborative project of the <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/">Center for Media and Democracy</a> to produce a directory of the people, organizations and issues shaping the public agenda.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Congresspedia">Congresspedia</a>: The "citizen's encyclopedia on Congress" that anyone can edit. Another project by the fine folks at the <a href="http://www.prwatch.org/">Center for Media and Democracy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.billhop.com/">BillHop.com</a>: A Wiki for Legislation and Issues of the Day.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://debatepedia.com">Debatepedia</a>: Debatepedia is the new free wiki encyclopedia of arguments and debates.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://daviswiki.org/">DavisWiki</a>: The definitive resource for Davis, California. (One of my favourite examples of a hyper-local city wiki!)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rocwiki.org/Front_Page">Rochester Wiki</a>: The People's guide to Rochester, NY.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.transitiontowns.org/">Transition Towns</a>: The aim of the site is to be a focal point for all towns, villages, cities and localities around the world that are self-organising for an energy-lean future.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.wikicancer.org/">WikiCancer</a>: A place for people with a connection to cancer to share real-life experiences -- fears, insights, stories and advice</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And, just for fun, you should probably check out <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/">Wookieepedia -- The Star Wars encyclopedia that anyone can edit.</a>. If you're interested in the software itself, there's a good list of Wiki software <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/">found on the Wiki Matrix</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Have other great examples?</strong> Please pop them in the comments.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I'll be doing a follow-up on event-specific Wiki examples next week. </p>
