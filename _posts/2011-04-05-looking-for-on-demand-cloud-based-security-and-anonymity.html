<p>I was kibitzing with a friend over coffee about information security last week.</p>

<p>Specifically, I described that I use a <a href="http://strongvpn.com">cheap, US-based, VPN service</a> (that I know nothing about) to keep my Internet traffic encrypted when I'm working from coffee shops and so on. I don't know the people at this company, nor what they're doing with the traffic once it gets to their hardware. For all I know, they're logging it all and giving it straight to the authorities. It wouldn't make for an exciting read, but that's not the point. So I was looking for some advice.</p>

<p>At this moment in the conversation, the friend recommended Tor, of course. I like <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>. I had used it many years ago. But, in the end, it was painfully slow for day-to-day use. </p>

<p>Part of the answer is more "friendly" organizations <a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-legal-faq.html.en">running Tor nodes</a>. Why doesn't Mozilla run a Tor node, the friend asked? I have no idea. (I'll have to ask when <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/AMO/FlightDeck/Meetings/3-23-11#Other_Topics">they're all back from Las Vegas</a>.) But, in light of recent world events, it is clear to me that <i>more</i> <a class="zem_slink rdfa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy" title="Internet privacy" rel="ctag:means wikipedia nofollow" xmlns:ctag="http://commontag.org/ns#" typeof="ctag:Tag" resource="http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/en/internet_privacy" property="ctag:label">Internet privacy</a> is a "good thing."</p>

<p>But it got me thinking: I don't need Tor <i>all</i> the time. In fact, I specifically only need it <i>some</i> of the time.</p>

<p>That thought collided with wanting to find an excuse to dive in to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon's Web Services</a>, and specifically their <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> offering, and I started wondering about setting up an on-demand VPN (maybe <a href="http://www.openswan.org/">Open Swan</a>?) and remote Tor client. </p>

<p>I'd like to be able to log-in to Amazon via SSL and fire up the EC2 instance (I like the idea of not having to pay a monthly fee, but just to be able to start and stop it when I need it).&nbsp;Once it started up, I could VPN to the server and have a Tor client running that I could connect to remotely, which would anonymize the traffic coming out the other end. (Honestly, I change laptops often enough that it would be more sensible to run Tor remotely and just connect to it. Crazy?)</p>

<p>I have no idea how hard this would be to set-up, or if it will event work as described. What better excuse to give it a try. </p>
