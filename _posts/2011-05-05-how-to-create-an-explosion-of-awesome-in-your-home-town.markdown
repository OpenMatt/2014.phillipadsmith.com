> _"Journalism and data collide into an awesome explosion" -- [BCNI Philly](http://bcniphilly.com)_

The Knight-Mozilla News Technology challenges [officially kicked off last week](http://drumbeat.org/journalism). The first challenge -- [Unlocking Video](https://drumbeat.org/en-US/challenges/unlocking-video/) -- has seen more than forty submissions with three days still to go until the challenge closes. (If you were going to submit an entry to this challenge, time to get a move on!)

By far, we've found that the most effective way to do outreach is face-to-face. To facilitate as much of that as possible, we're working with [Hacks/Hackers](http://hackshackers.com) and other organizations to encourage local events that bring people together to brainstorm challenge entries.

So far, there have been outreach events in:

* [San Francisco](http://wendynorris.posterous.com/knight-mozilla-throw-down-news-innovation-cha)
* [Buenos Aires](http://hackshackers.com/blog/2011/04/29/hackshackers-invades-buenos-aires-with-data-journalism-and-journalism-with-data/)
* Philadelphia
* [Boston](http://meetupbos.hackshackers.com/events/17327239/)

There are currently [events planned](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Mojo/meetups#Calendar) for:

* Managua, May 8
* San Salvador, May 11
* Guatemala City, May 13
* Dundee May 27 (tentative)
* London, May 28 (tentative)
* Birmingham, UK, May 31
* Seattle, TBA
* Berlin, TBA

Don't see your city listed? What a perfect opportunity to pick-up the gauntlet and organize one. [Michelle Thorne](https://twitter.com/thornet/) has been kind enough to [pull together a bunch of resources to help you organize your own local event](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Mojo/meetups) -- it's easy, it's fun, and a great excuse to get your local 'hacks' and hackers together.

(I especially like the new [Bingo cards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/3/33/Mojobingo.pdf) that [Jenny 8. Lee](http://www.jennifer8lee.com/) suggested. Great ice breaker.)

Most recently, I headed down to Philadelphia to do a (super-productive, if I say so myself) MoJo session at [BarCamp News Innovation](http://bcniphilly.com/). As usual, I managed to corner a bunch of interesting people, point a video camera at them, and then asked them what they were doing there:

<br />

Many thanks to the following folks for subjecting themselves to the camera:

* Sean Blanda from [TechnicallyPhilly.com](http://technicallyphilly.com/)
* Andrew Mendelson from [Temple University](http://www.temple.edu/)
* Kyle, Allan, Aaron, and Amandine from [War News Radio](http://www.warnewsradio.org/)
* Wendy Warren from [Philly.com](http://philly.com)
* Bas Slabbers from [NewsWorks.org](http://newsworks.org)
* Tim Wisniewski a 'Geek-in-command' at the hackathon
* And the various other folks that got caught in the frame

If you'd like help creating an 'explosion of awesome' in your city, or at your next event, [drop us a line](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/Mojo/meetups#Calendar).
