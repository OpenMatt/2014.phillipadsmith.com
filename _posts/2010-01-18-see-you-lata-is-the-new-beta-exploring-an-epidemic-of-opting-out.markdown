title: '"See you lata''" is the new "beta." Exploring an epidemic of opting out.'
date: '2010-01-18 14:33:34 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Is it just me, or is there a bit of a collective unconscious thing going
  on here? Perhaps it's just a \"meme\" that is spreading like a avian virus throughout
  the networks that I'm connected to via my work; networks that typically are pretty
  \"techie\" and kinda' into social media. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When did it start? I can't
  put my finger on it exactly, but there was a feeling like the world had hit the
  backside of a bubble or a bell curve when Lauren Bacon wrote \"<a href=\"http://www.laurenandemira.com/2009/0915how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-twitter/\">How
  I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Twitter</a>.\" A self-described Web \"early
  adopter and enthusiast of all things internetty\" had given in to the irresistible
  final frontier of social media: Twitter.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that point on, there
  was a quickening: it was the dawn of the late-adopter-early-adopter, and then came
  the rush of the rest of the world. In summary: social media was mainstream. It was
  <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=twitter\">talked
  about</a> in mainstream media and had become the basis for many a party game (Who's
  going to mention Facebook first tonight?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, there was another
  energy in the room that day. It was the yin to the yang, the black to the white,
  and the rebel to the mainstream. There it was: a collective <em>sigh</em> and \"We
  told you so,\" followed by the question \"What the !@#$% do we do now that <em>everyone</em>
  is on Twitter.\" And, with that, the air started to slowly leek out of the ballon.
  Pffffffffffffsssssssssssssssssssss. No shit. Just like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had
  heard the rumblings! You probably heard them too? People lamenting the state of
  the virtual non-state. First, Second Life seemed to fall off the edge of the world
  as people starting <a href=\"http://www.getafirstlife.com/\">getting a first life</a>.
  It was like a collective cheer: \"Hey Second Life! Welcome to <em>Dumpsville</em>,
  population <em>you</em>.\" Then there was MySpace and so on. And, unless you lived
  in the kind of country that doesn't love Starbucks, it was like all that was left
  was a social media monoculture: Facebook, or Twitter (or maybe LinkedIn if you're
  a bit square). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, nature abhors a monoculture, and so it seems
  with the InterWebby-thing. Without the b-list, c-list, and -- heck -- d-list social
  networks out there (<em>cough</em>Orkut<em>cough</em>hi5<em>cough</em>Bebo<em>cough</em>),
  everyone was trying to get in on the a-list options without reading their copy of
  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Etiquette-Dummies-Psychology-Self-Help/dp/0470106727/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263605272&amp;sr=1-3\">Etiquette
  For Dummies</a> first. It was a classic tragedy of the commons. All of a sudden,
  you're following 4000 people that you don't know and have 1000 friends from a part
  of your life you kinda' wanted to forget. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it was only a matter
  of time...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we are, it's the future. We rounded the corner of
  the 21st century and ran smack into Year of the Avatar (which was 2009 by the way,
  but it was a late release). The \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Multitude-War-Democracy-Age-Empire/dp/0143035592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263605369&amp;sr=1-1\">multitude</a>\"
  was online, at last. And with the multitude, all of the challenging personalities
  that inevitability intrude on any good party (<a href=\"http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2009/03/five-reasons-you-should-not-friend-your-parents-on-facebook.shtml\">including
  our parents</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we come to this year -- 2010 -- the year where
  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/01/11/twitter-growth-stats/\">social media flatlines</a>.
  Only herein lies the humour about the tragedy of the social media commons: The early
  adopters are becoming the <a href=\"http://jstahl.org/archives/2010/01/12/unplugging-from-the-social-networks/\">early
  opt-outers</a>, the drop-outs, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement\">back-to-the-landers</a>.
  Those that once built their kingdoms on social media, <a href=\"http://www.winwithoutpitching.com/2010-unplugged\">are
  now unplugging</a> in search of a more peaceful, less distracting, existence. (It
  can afflict <a href=\"http://twobullsinachinashop.com/2010/01/hands-off-my-virtual-flowers.shtml\">any
  of us</a> at a moment's notice, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/phillipadsmith/status/5362710215\">it
  would seem</a>.) </p> \r\n\r\n<p>The search for a simple, meaningful, life takes
  many paths, I guess. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you are weary and over-loaded and would
  like to opt-out too, you're in luck: You can <em>finally</em> get in on something
  early enough to qualify as an \"early adopter.\" Everything that was old is new
  again, and \"See you lata'\" is the new \"beta.\" Ready to opt-out? No problem:
  there are social media solutions <a href=\"http://suicidemachine.org/\">ready and
  waiting for your call</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us remember, however, as we reflect
  on 2009 and prepare to rush into 2010, that not much has really changed in life.
  Those things that fulfilled us before social media are still hanging around: friends,
  family, nature, and so on. So, as it happens, in this one aspect of life -- second
  life vs. first life -- you <em>can</em> have your cake and eat it too. Just take
  care not to eat so much that you get sick. </p>"
