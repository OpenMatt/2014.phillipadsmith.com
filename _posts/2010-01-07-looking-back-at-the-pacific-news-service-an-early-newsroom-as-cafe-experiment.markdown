title: 'Looking back at the Pacific News Service: an early "newsroom as cafe" experiment?'
date: '2010-01-07 19:41:46 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Continuing with the theme of stories... I was struck yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/fishing-for-the-real-story-about-news-innovation\">when
  speaking to  David Beers</a>, about the sense of community that he's trying to weave
  into the fabric of The Tyee's newsroom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I shared with David that
  the idea of bringing the community <i>into</i> the newsroom -- or the newsroom into
  the community -- had recently been discussed on the <a href=\"http://rebootnews.com/2009/10/19/rebooting-the-news-29/\">Rebooting
  the News podcast</a>, and by \"hacker journalist\" Daniel Bachhuber <a href=\"http://www.danielbachhuber.com/2009/06/12/newsroom-as-a-cafe/\">on
  his blog</a>, under the banner of \"Newsroom as cafe.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>David chuckled
  a bit, as he described his early careers experiences working in the San Francisco-based
  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_News_Service\">Pacific News Service</a>
  newsroom in the 80s. He described it as a place that was open to the community;
  where \"anyone could come in for their Monday [editorial] meeting\" and thus take
  part in the news process. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He finished with the sentiment that these
  ideas are not necessarily new, but they <em>are</em> often are the ones that have
  been lost in the contemporary, profit-driven, newsroom. So, as news becomes more
  narrowcast, and fights to be more relevant to people's lives, it would seem to that
  these ideas of community-connected newsrooms are ripe to be rediscovered. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's
  stories like these that keep me engaged.</p>"
