No big surprise here. Just another "free" hosted service <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-seesmic-buys-social-network-updating-service-ping.fm/">getting purchased</a> and potentially leaving users in the lurch. This time it was social network update service Ping.fm. <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2009/12/the-shifting-sand-of-free-hosted-web-services.shtml">Mark my words</a>: Posterous, Tumblr --and just about ever other service that's lacking a solid business plan -- will eventually be absorbed by the all-consuming Borg.
