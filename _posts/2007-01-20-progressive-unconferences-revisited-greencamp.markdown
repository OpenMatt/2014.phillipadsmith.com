title: 'Progressive Unconferences revisited: GreenCamp'
date: '2007-01-20 18:35:00 -0600'
excerpt: |-
  <p>Wow -- I was super-stoked to open-up my newsreader this morning to find <a href="http://greencamp.pbwiki.com/">GreenCamp</a> listed on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/126940/">Upcoming</a>. Last spring <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/progressive-unconferences#comment-8">David Crow</a> and I <a href="http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/progressive-unconferences">bantered about the opportunity for  social-mission organizations to use the "unconference" format</a> as a way to facilitate new conversations around progressive ideas. It's incredible to actually see this happening -- <em>And right here in Toronto too!</em> Think I'll be making it out to that event for sure.</p>

  <p>GreenCamp isn't the only progressive unconference around. There's a whole new movement afoot, including Chris Messina's <a href="http://barcamp.org/WineCamp">WineCamp</a>, New Organizing Institute's <a href="https://rootscamp.pbwiki.com/">RootsCamp</a>, and the Media Consortium's recent <a href="http://consorttechcamp.pbwiki.com/">ConsortTechCamp</a>. Though not an official "Camp"-style unconference, I like to think of <a href="http://webofchange.org">Web of Change</a> as a progressive unconference, and I hope that <a href="http://barcamp.org/CopyCamp">Misha's summary of lessons</a> from the recent <a href="http://copycamp.ca">CopyCamp</a> added to the mix of ideas on how to use the unconference model for change. </p>

  <p>Know of other progressive unconferences? Pop 'em in the comments!  :-)</p>
