excerpt: |-
  <p>Good article quoting the usual suspects over at Charity Village:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Unless you work in IT, you probably don't give much thought to whether the software you use is licensed or open source, freeware or shareware; you just want it to work properly. But with the flexibility and affordability that open source and shareware programs can offer, some nonprofits are taking a closer look. Find out about the available software alternatives and whether they might be right for your organization in this week's cover story at: <a href="http://www.charityvillage.com/cv/news/cover.asp">http://www.charityvillage.com/cv/news/cover.asp</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>(Not sure how long that link will work, so let me know if it's not working.)</p>

  <p>Also fun to see that all those lessons on dealing with spam <a href="http://www.citynews.ca/international/day/5-25-2007.aspx">have finally paid off</a> for <a href="http://www.markgreenspan.com/">Mark Greenspan</a>. Mark was over for dinner on the weekend and couldn't stop talking about the <a href="http://www.futureofdigitalcontent.com/media.releases.php?mid=7">Net Neutrality panel</a> (lots of familiar names there) that he is helping to program at <a href="http://www.futureofdigitalcontent.com/">Next Media 2007</a>. </p>
