**Thank you, each and every one of you, who helped to promote and fund the Beautiful Trouble Kickstarter campaign.**

I was [on the road last week](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2117094/mozilla-talks-inquirer-aop-hack-day), so I didn't have a chance to post an update on the campaign. Not only did we hit the target, we flew right past it in the final hours.

I see lots of familiar names in the [list of project backers](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/151304769/beautiful-trouble/backers). Thank you, again.

In addition to the 246 individuals who contributed to Beautiful Trouble, we also received a very generous commitment from the [Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada](http://www.cep.ca/). Add to that the previous support of another Canadian labour organization, several generous contributions from a "friends and family" round of outreach, and the support of a US foundation and our amazing publisher, and we're __really__ off to the races.

The third Beautiful Trouble book sprint kicks off later this month, and the book design is well underway. In the coming weeks, we'll be re-launching the [www.beautifultrouble.org](http://beautifultrouble.org) Web site and making the book available for pre-order in a variety of formats.

I keep pushing the team to not constrain the vision for the project to just "a book," and I'm excited to get back to thinking about how the Web can play a role in making the content widely accessible, and also allowing it to live and grow over time.

As the [Occupy movement](http://www.occupytogether.org/) spreads across the globe -- including right here in Toronto -- I can think of a better time for a resource that shares the "design patterns" of creative activism.

I look forward to making some beautiful trouble with all of you.
