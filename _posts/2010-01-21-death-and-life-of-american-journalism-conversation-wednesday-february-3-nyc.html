<p>Following up on the <a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2010/01/reading-list-death-and-life-of-journalism-news-literacy-and-more.shtml">reading list posted earlier this week</a>, I just received this note from <a href="http://thenation.com/">The Nation</a>:

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Death and Life of American Journalism
    <br />
   A Conversation, Wednesday, February 3, NYC
    <br />
   <br />Everyone agrees that a free society requires a free press. But a free press without the resources to compensate those who gather and analyze information, and to distribute that information widely and in an easily accessible form, is like a seed without water or sunlight. So how do we save journalism? 
    <br />
   <br />In their celebrated new book, <em>The Death and Life of American Journalism,  </em>John Nichols and Robert McChesney make the patriotic case for government action. In a special forum, <strong>Nichols</strong> and <strong>McChesney</strong> will discuss and debate the most hopeful remedies for the malaise of the media with media experts <strong>David Carr</strong> of the New York Times and <strong>Pamela Newkirk</strong> of the New York University Journalism School in a conversation moderated by GRIT TV's <strong>Laura Flanders</strong>. Nation editor <strong>Katrina vanden Heuvel</strong> will perform the introduction. The panel will be followed by a book-signing by Nichols and McChesney. 
    <br />
   <br />This <strong>free event</strong> takes place on <strong>Wednesday, February 3, at 7:00</strong> at the New York Society for Ethical Culture in Manhattan. Staged by The Nation. Co-sponsored by Free Press, the New York Socirty for Ethical Culture and Nation Books.
