  <p>As an avid magazine reader, I'm constantly on the lookout for new titles. <a href="http://www.needmagazine.com/index.htm">Need Magazine</a> came across my desk the other day via <a href="http://newint.org">New Internationalist</a>. Looks interesting -- a bit like Yes! magazine but for the global development community -- so I'm going to check it out. Once I've got the first issue, I'll post an update.</p>
