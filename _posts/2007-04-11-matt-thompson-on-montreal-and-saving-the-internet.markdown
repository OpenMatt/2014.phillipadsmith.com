title: Matt Thompson on Montreal and Saving the Internet
date: '2007-04-11 21:26:57 -0500'
excerpt: |-
  <p><a href="http://www.webofchange.com">Web of Change alumnus</a> and friend to all freedom fighters -- Matt Thompson -- was nominated for a <a href="">Webby award</a> yesterday for his fantastic work on the <a href="">SavetheInternet.com</a> viral video (The Webby awards are like the Oscars of the Internet). He's a super-deserving and hardworking producer and you should really consider taking 10 minutes right now to support him: go <a href="http://peoplesvoice.webbyawards.com/account/login">register</a> and then go vote <a href="http://pv.webbyawards.com/nominee/entry/364">here</a> and <a href="http://pv.webbyawards.com/nominee/entry/363">here</a>. </p>

  <p>Matt says "We never would have been nominated if it weren't for the efforts of Internet activists, bloggers, videomakers and citizens across the country. Winning a Webby would be a great recognition for those efforts – and help drive new traffic and media attention to our campaign. So please cast your vote – and ask friends to vote as well!"</p>

  <p>Matt's also trying to lure Melanie and I up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal">Montreal</a> for some <a href="http://www.birding.com/">birding</a> this spring, and no one can wax poetic about Montreal like Matt can:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The weather is FINALLY getting nice. Soon the streets will be alive with sexy French girls and boys, drinking frivolously on patios scented with the air of
    maple-dripped swallows and hummingbirds! And the rare triple-toed horndecker is native to Parc Lafontaine, near our apartment! You guys
    will have to come and bring your binoculars! We'll pack a picnic full of figs and Cheval Blanc with lemon! What say ye?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Don't you just want to power up the <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004357.html">eco-car</a> and head right on up there?</p>

  <p><strong>I sure do!</strong></p>
