<p>It's funny, I just downloaded the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Would-Google-Jeff-Jarvis/dp/0061709719">What would Google do?</a>" by Jeff Jarvis from <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&productID=BK_HARP_001794">Audible.com</a> this past weekend. (Yah, it's true. I'm addicted to audiobooks.) </p>
<p>
So what would Google do if it couldn't buy "affordable, utility-scale, renewable energy" in their markets? <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10427993-54.html">They'd start an energy company, of course</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't started the book yet, but I'm guessing there's a chapter on this somewhere in there... I'll let you know.</p>
