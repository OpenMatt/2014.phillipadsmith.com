  <p><strong>Editors &amp; publishers: have you ever asked yourself the question "When should print content go online?" If so, you're in luck...</strong></p>

  <p>A handful of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to ask <a href="http://www.themediaconsortium.org/">some of the most influential publications in the US</a> (and a handful of my colleagues in the publishing business in Canada) that very question. </p>

<p><strong>Editors &amp; publishers: have you ever asked yourself the question "When should print content go online?" If so, you're in luck...</strong></p>

<p>A handful of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to ask <a href="http://www.themediaconsortium.org/">some of the most influential publications in the US</a> (and a handful of my colleagues in the publishing business in Canada) that very question. </p>

<p>I received about ten responses, ranging from smaller bi-monthly publications to large weeklies. The responses were very interesting, and quite consistent. I've compiled the responses here:

<p><strong>Staggering your content additions</strong></p>

<p>The answer was almost unanimous: the addition of print content to the Web site should be staggered. </p>

<p>This trend was either because resources were limited (i.e., the resources aren't available to put all of the content online at once), or -- more often -- because the content is used to <strong>keep the Web site fresh</strong> by slowly adding the content over the time between editions. </p>

<p><strong>Before subscribers get the content?</strong></p>

<p>A related question that always comes is "Should it go online <em>before</em> subscribers get their subscription? Or after...?"</p>

<p>There were two trends here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Those publications that aim to have some, most, or all of their print content online by the time that the print magazine reaches   subscribers.</p></li>
<li><p>And those that start putting print online at the time it reaches   subscribers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When publications put content online ahead of when print subscribers receive the issue, the content is often online-only content that is referenced from the print magazine, or selections from  the magazine that are timely and relevant.</p>

<p>And, of those that choose to delay putting content online until after   subscribers receive the issue: everyone indicated that they <em>would</em> put content online ahead of schedule if it was breaking news, e.g., stories on the Gaza conflict, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Even more to think about!</strong></p>

<p>A number of the people who responded provided some great additional reasons for why content should go online in a staggered format:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's better to stagger content for search engine optimization (smaller, more frequent, updates to the site) </p></li>
<li><p>RSS subscribers that don't want 30 new articles at once</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And for putting content online as soon as possible / before the print   subscribers receive the issue:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Subscribers wanting online access to an article that isn't online yet (to share, or blog about) </p></li>
<li><p>Acquiring casual readers that aren't likely print subscribers </p></li>
<li><p>And, most commonly / perhaps most importantly: social media factor. No content = no sharing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Getting these responses really helped my thinking on the issue, and confirmed a number of casual observations around when publications are putting their print content online. (Thanks to everyone that shared their thoughts with me!)</p>

<p>Hopefully the question of "if" a publication should put print content online has already been answered.  ;-)</p>
