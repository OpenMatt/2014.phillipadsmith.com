Yep, it's true, thirty-eight years ago today, I was tossed, kicking and screaming, into this world. I've been trying not to screw it up ever since.

Like many, I have a love-hate relationship with birthdays, but this year it's all love.

Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I feel like I'm in better shape, smarter, and happier than I have ever been, and I have a sense in my gut that it's only going to get better. That's a nice place to be when you're staring straight down the barrel of the big four-oh.

April is also a fun month for celebrating because it's the month that I officially hung out my shingle as an independent consultant, just over eight years ago.

I once read that less than 50% of new businesses last more than five years, so every year after the fifth has felt like a real victory over the odds.

Thinking back, I like to remember the story of "my first big client," _Grist magazine_ (now they just call themselves [Grist](http://grist.org)). Grist had published a 50+ page request for proposal for a content-management system, and -- in one short week -- an ad-hoc team was pulled together and a proposal submitted.

When we heard that we made the short list, we went so far as to send a baby monitor to the Grist office with a note that said _"We'll always be there for you."_

Those were some fun days; it was all raw energy, creativity, and a hefty dose of naivet&eacute;.

We got the contract.

We took Grist from a static HTML site that they were updating by hand:

<a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-old-856.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-old-856.html','popup','width=842,height=740,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-old-thumb-400x351-856.jpg" width="400" height="351" alt="grist-old.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

<br />
To an [industrial-strength CMS](http://www.bricolagecms.org) that met their needs for the next four and a half years:

<a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-new-857.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-new-857.html','popup','width=722,height=560,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2011/04/grist-new-thumb-400x310-857.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="grist-new.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a>

<br />
It was a challenging project. But it was the important first step on a path that has kept me working closely with online publishers ever since.

Call me crazy, but I can't wait to get started on the next eight years.

The real work will have to wait until tomorrow, however, because Rule No. 1 in the _Phillip Smith 'Tao of Consulting' Handbook_ is **"Let go, when your work is done (or when it's your birthday)."**
