Lately I've been pretty lucky in terms of working with talented designers: most recently, working with  Alex Grunenfelder at [The Tyee](http://thetyee.ca) on [Style Tiles for a new project](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2012/11/adventures-with-style-tiles-at-the-tyee.html), and Cristian Fleming from [The Public Society](http://www.thepublicsociety.com/) on [Beautiful Trouble](http://beautifultrouble.org). Working with people like this, I viscerally understand the difference between a _good_ designer, and a truly **great** designer.

I'm fortunate to have had the opportunity to collaborate with some pretty amazing graphic designers over the years, but it's been rare for me to work with a designer who really, _really_ gets the Web too. Thus, another memorable highlight was working with [Andy Clarke](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/) on the [New Internationalist](http://newint.org) re-design in 2009. We had some fun back-and-forth discussions about [CSS frameworks](http://www.newint.org/blog/tech/2009/04/08/semantically-speaking/) as he [blogged the whole exercise](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andy+clarke+new+internationalist+redesign). It's fun to keep bumping into Andy's name, on projects like [320 and up](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/). 

A few weeks ago I started working with a new designer, [Adrienne Conley](https://twitter.com/adrienneconley), who's part of the super-impressive volunteer team supporting the [Ryan Meili campaign for leadership of the Saskatchewan NDP](www.ryanmei.li). 

The task for us was to create an Obama-esque splash page for Ryan's campaign site that focused on collecting visitor's e-mail addresses into [Nation Builder](http://nationbuilder.com) for follow-up. 

A quick look at the analytics showed that a growing number of visitors were arriving at the site on a variety of mobile devices: smartphones, tablets, Blackberrys, and so on. So we decided early on to develop a responsive splash page that would work across screen sizes. 

<a href="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/files/ryanmeili-320x480-splashpage.jpg"><img alt="Ryan Meili splash page design, mobile." src="http://www.phillipadsmith.com/assets_c/2012/11/ryanmeili-320x480-splashpage-thumb-320x636-1504.jpg" width="320" height="636" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a>

Instead of the [Style Tiles approach that we experimented with recently at The Tyee](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2012/11/adventures-with-style-tiles-at-the-tyee.html), Adrienne provided me with simple designs at two reference sizes -- 1200 x 800px (shown above) and 320 x 480px -- and stuck to Web- and mobile-friendly typography (Tahoma and Arial in this case). 

The designs that Adrienne delivered were perfect: both eye-pleasing and modular, and with enough visual freedom that I could improvise at all of the various breakpoints. The result, should you want to try it out, is [here](http://ryanmei.li?splash=1). 

What I really got me stoked about this little project was the opportunity to develop my own personal boilerplate CSS for the common mobile breakpoints. On projects like [Beautiful Trouble](http://beautifultrouble.org) and [Occupy America](http://occupy-us.org), I was developing on top of [Twitter's Bootstrap framework](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) for speed and convenience. However, for a simple splash page, using something like Bootstrap would have been overkill. Starting from scratch with the [HTML5 boiler plate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) for the page structure and a blank CSS file really gave me a chance to start [mobile first](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first) and then build the page **up** to the large screen sizes (in this case, by picking and choosing what I wanted from Boostrap's responsive tools). 

Things have come a long way, given that I probably started experimenting in earnest with [responsive Web design](http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2011/12/28/ResponsiveDesign/) ideas in February 2011 when I stumbled on Joni Korpi's [Less Framework](http://lessframework.com/); a year-and-a-half later, I'm pulled between two ends of a very-distant spectrum: at one end is [the idea that the future of a responsive Web lays in Typography](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-responsive-web-will-be-99-9-typography/), at the other end lies a [global network of device labs](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/24/establishing-an-open-device-lab/). Both are appealing for entirely different reasons. 

But, at the end of the day -- responsive or not -- working with a truly fscking great designer makes makes it that much easier to slack off and noodle the bigger questions in life ("Typography?" "Device Lab?" ...).
