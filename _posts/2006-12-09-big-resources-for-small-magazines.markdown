These <a href="http://magazinescanada.ca/small_magazines.php?cat=sm_research">11 'hotsheets'</a> cover the gamut: Blogs and Small Magazines (by yours truly), Developing Your Niche, Fundraising for Small Magazines, Online Circulation Promotions (by colleague John Spencer), Swaps and Exchanges (by friend Lisa Whittington-Hill of <a href="http://www.thismagazine.ca">This Magazine</a>), Online Editorial Features, and much more.
