The [#MozNewsLab](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&tag=MozNewsLab) is hurtling toward the grand finale on August 5th. We're past the half-way mark, and it feels like time is compressing each day into a New York minute.

We wrapped up week two of the lab last Friday. Here's a quick recap:

The first lecture last week was a shot-in-the-arm of open-Web goodness: The Mozilla Foundation's Executive Director [Mark Surman](http://commonspace.wordpress.com/) talked about the broader Mozilla + Journalism initiative, touched on [Why Mozilla cares about news](http://www.slideshare.net/openjournalism/why-does-mozilla-care-about-news), and introduced out guest speaker, [Christian Heilmann](http://wait-till-i.com/).

From there, Heilmann -- a developer 'evangelist' at Mozilla -- took participants on a whirlwind tour of the [State of the Browser in 2011](http://www.slideshare.net/openjournalism/christian-heilmanns-state-of-the-browser-in-2011). HTML5, CSS3, new APIs, WebGL -- you name it, he covered it. You can find the lecture online [here](http://p2pu.org/en/groups/knight-mozilla-learning-lab/content/lecture-no-4-with-chris-heilmann/): [recording](http://ps.ht/n7y6Ol), [notes](http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/lecture-four-resources), and [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/openjournalism/christian-heilmanns-state-of-the-browser-in-2011).

Next up was none other than [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/). Resig is implicated in more successful open-source software projects that you can shake a stick at. He's been leading the [jQuery project](http://jquery.com/) for more than five years now, and has learned a lot about the '[Open Source Process](http://www.slideshare.net/openjournalism/open-source-process-jquery-by-john-resig)': the ins-and-outs of building great software _and_ a great community that supports it. John shared those learnings with the lab -- it was an incredibly insightful voyage through the history of jQuery, and John's tips on creating successful open-source software community.

Jesse James Garrett -- the '[Father of AJAX](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8423589896008260057)' -- joined us on Friday to deliver the final lecture of the week. His talk focused on the conceptual model for thinking about successful interactive experiences, what he calls the '[Elements of User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/)'. I must admit, I was quite excited to hear Jesse speak, as I've been a big fan ever since [reading his book many](http://www.jjg.net/elements/), many years ago. Jesse expanded quite a bit on the early models of user experience that he pioneered and ofter many insightful new ideas about how to approach the experience of a software project or product.

We've just kicked off week three. Hope you're [following along](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&tag=MozNewsLab). There's still time to send a '[message in a bottle](http://www.phillipadsmith.com/2011/07/hey-newsrooms-get-your-voices-heard-send-a-message-in-a-bottle-to-the-moznewslab.html)' to the lab.

Last but not least, Mozilla's [Media, Freedom and the Web festival](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Festival2011) is really starting to come together. If you're interested in the nexus of the open Web and media production, you may want to [mark your calendar](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Festival2011).
