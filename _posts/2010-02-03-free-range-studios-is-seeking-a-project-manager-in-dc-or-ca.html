<p>Quite possibly one of the <a href="http://www.freerangestudios.com/multimedia-project-manager.html">coolest jobs in the world</a>, working with some of the most hard-working people in creative activism, and the clients aren't so bad either.</p>

<a href="http://www.freerangestudios.com/multimedia-project-manager.html"> 
Free Range Studios is seeking a Project Manager</a> responsible for managing print, web and/or web 2.0 design projects from initial estimates through implementation, product delivery and final billing. This work includes strategizing with and advising clients to best solve their communication challenges, managing and overseeing the project team made up of designers and programmers, maintaining an overall high standard of quality and offering superior customer service. Ideal candidate is an enthusiastic self-starter who's not afraid to admit being an Internet junkie.
