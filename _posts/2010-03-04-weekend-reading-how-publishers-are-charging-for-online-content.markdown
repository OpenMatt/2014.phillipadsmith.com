title: 'Weekend reading: How publishers are charging for online content'
date: '2010-03-04 03:20:40 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>Many of the publishers I work with are (still) grappling with questions
  about charging for content: if, why, how, and so on. These questions can become
  almost paralyzing when taken to their extreme, and in this situation I've <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/phillipadsmith/build-it-online-and-they-will-come\">often
  advocated</a> to \"give it away or don’t: pick one,\" i.e., choose a direction,
  stick with it for a while, and then re-assess. Nonetheless, there will be those
  that want to fret over the decision endlessly and to carefully consider every angle
  -- and those folks will want to have a look at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ajbruce\">Alastair
  Bruce's</a> recent presentation about \"<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ajbruce/charging-for-content\">Charging
  for content</a>.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ajbruce/charging-for-content\">Bruce's
  presentation</a> is a thorough examination of the current state of affairs in the
  online publishing world. He offers a comparison chart the explores the different
  models used by major newspapers, local news, and specialist publications. He delves
  into the specifics of many of the models -- micro-payments, metering, freemiums,
  etc. -- and leaves us with a nice snapshot of the landscape that's current to February
  2010. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will be a great addition to your weekend reading list, I
  promise. I particularly liked the exploration of how publishers are pulling social
  media, search advertising, and other models (membership, etc.) into their revenue
  mix. Great stuff and hope to see more like this from Mr. Bruce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Thanks
  to <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/author/mcoddington/\">Mark Coddington's</a>
  weekly roundup at <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org\">Neiman Journalism Lab</a>
