The kick-ass folks at [Radical Designs](http://www.radicaldesigns.org/) are l[ooking for a multi-talented person to join their team](http://www.radicaldesigns.org/job-posting-radical-designs-seek-a-special-someone) in San Francisco:

> Radical Designs makes websites and technology for progressive non-profits and grassroots orgs. Radical Designs is seeking someone who blends web technology skills, online campaigning, and project management, and is committed to progressive social change.

> We're emphasizing web design and implementation skill in this position but this is a great opportunity for people with a range of backgrounds, from web programming to organizing, to work with groups on a variety of campaigns within the progressive movement. Radical Designs has a strong culture of skill sharing so don't hesitate to apply because you lack a skill listed above.

I've been a big fan of Radical Designs since connecting with them at the [Designs on Democracy conference](http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2004/03/30/16756331.php) in 2004. Looks like a great opportunity for someone looking to work with a great team and great clients. [Get cracking](http://www.radicaldesigns.org/job-posting-radical-designs-seek-a-special-someone)!
