I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Collar-Economy-Solution-Problems/dp/0061650757">The Green Collar Economy</a> over the holidays. The first time I saw the author -- Van Jones -- speak at <a href="http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2004/03/30/16756331.php">Designs on Democracy conference</a> he was a force to behold. Since then, he's been driving a movement toward a complete retooling of the US economy toward "Green Jobs." But, as I read the book, the question remains: Why is it taking so long? If you have questions too, <a href="http://www.good.is/post/Ask-the-Energy-Expert-Why-Is-Solar-Taking-So-Long">Good Magazine is asking readers</a> to send in their questions to their energy expert.
