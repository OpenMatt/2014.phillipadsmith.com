excerpt: <p>In January, while checking out the <a href="http://www.indypress.org/">Independent
  Press Association&#8217;s conference in San Francisco</a>, Matt Thompson and I put
  our heads together to explore some ideas about extending the work of progressive
  publications &#8212; namely magazines &#8212; online. Matt&#8217;s background as
  a journalist and producer at <a href="http://www.iwtnews.com/">Independent World
  Television</a> (now called The Real News) led to many conversations about short
  online mini-documentaries; my background working on online campaigns had me focused
  on a compelling story and e-mail acquisition. And, we both struggled with some basic
  questions about the challenges for traditionally print-based publications as they
  struggle with how to deliver their content online.</p>

<p>In January, while checking out the <a href="http://www.indypress.org/">Independent Press Association&#8217;s conference in San Francisco</a>, Matt Thompson and I put our heads together to explore some ideas about extending the work of progressive publications &#8212; namely magazines &#8212; online. Matt&#8217;s background as a journalist and producer at <a href="http://www.iwtnews.com/">Independent World Television</a> (now called The Real News) led to many conversations about short online mini-documentaries; my background working on online campaigns had me focused on a compelling story and e-mail acquisition. And, we both struggled with some basic questions about the challenges for traditionally print-based publications as they struggle with how to deliver their content online.</p>

<p>On that trip, I had the opportunity to meet with the Publisher of <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine Jay Harris and Bruce McCurdy the General Manager for <em>Mother Jones</em> online (many thanks to <a href="http://communicopia.net">Jason Mogus</a> for putting us in touch). At that meeting, we discussed their then <a href="http://motherjones.com/toc/2006/03/index.html">upcoming issue</a> on the Last Days of the Ocean. It was a powerful magazine that digs deep into the issues that are ahead of us thanks to climate change. At that meeting, Jay and Bruce presented me with a design challenge: how can we increase the impact of this magazine using the Internet? </p>

Two weeks later Matt and I delivered a proposal back to the folks at <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine. And the result of that proposal &#8212; thanks to the legendary effort of Matt as the day-to-day producer and Laura Shapiro the design lead at <em>Mother Jones</em> (and the support of many other people at Mother Jones and here in Toronto) &#8212; is the <a href="http://oceanvoyager.org">Ocean Voyager</a> experience. I encourage you to check it out, invite your friends, and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in some of the thinking behind this campaign approach and looking at some of our early mock-ups of the idea, I&#8217;ve attached the <a href="http://communitybandwidth.ca/files/fate_of_the_ocean_ideas.pdf">propsal and slides</a> to this post. What I&#8217;m most interested in is your ideas on how to improve, evolve, or re-mix this idea for other types of organizations and campaigns. 
</p>
<p>
Your first assignment is to visit <a href="http://oceanvoyager.org">Ocean Voyager</a> and sign-up for the experience.</p>

<p>
Then your second is to report back here after five weeks and tell me what you think. Where does it succeed? Where does it fail? Is it a strategy that you could put to use in your organization? On one of your campaigns? In your classroom?
