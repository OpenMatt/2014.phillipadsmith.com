date: '2007-01-29 15:47:59 -0600'
excerpt: "<p>If you caught <a href=\"http://www.communitybandwidth.ca/phillipadsmith/try-civicspace-on-demand\">my
  earlier post about CivicSpace On Demand service</a> -- a Web-based solution for
  content management, contact management, e-mail communication, and fundraising directed
  at progressive non-profits -- you may be interested in this note from David Geilhufe
  and the Civicspace team:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are happy to announce the
  open public release of the CivicSpace On Demand service, offering a complete, integrated
  solution for your community website, online donations, blast email, and supporter
  database needs.</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on your past interest in our services, we'd
  love it if you would be among our first customers to get Groundswell Professional,
  an integrated fundraising, email, website and database solution at $50 per month
  with your first 30 days free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was talk of a Canadian
  version of the service, hosted in Canada, but it seems that those conversations
  have stalled. Hopefully the fine folks at Civicspace will find a friendly Canadian
  partner soon! In the meantime, <a href=\"http://civicspacelabs.org/services_main\">go
  check out what they're offering in Groundswell Professional.</a></p>"
