I receive approximately two encrypted e-mails a day at the moment. That's probably a 200% increase over this time last year.

Let's get started:

## Register a Keybase account

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) is still in "private alpha," so if you don't have an invite code you're going to be stuck in their queue for a little while. There are obviously lots of ways to jump the queue, including asking your friends for an invite. 

I've successfully invited more than twenty people to Keybase over the last few months. In exchange for the invite code, I try to encourage and support them in getting a public key published and exchanging an encrypted message with me. 

If you're received an invitation from me, the process looks something like this:

![Keybase.io e-mail invitation from me!]({{site.baseurl}}/files/0_keybase_email_invite.jpg)
Look for an e-mail from `keybase.io` in your e-mail client. If you can't find it at first, check your "Promotions" tab in Gmail, or your "junk" folder or what-have-you. Maybe search for it.

![Confirm that e-mail address]({{site.baseurl}}/files/0_keybase_email_confirm.jpg)
Clicking the link in the e-mail will lead you to this page.

![1_keybase_already_have_a_code.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/files/1_keybase_already_have_a_code.jpg)
Alternately, you can simply head to the [Keybase](https://keybase.io) site, click "Join" in the top right corner, and then click the "Already have a code?" link.

The most important step when registering your Keybase account is picking an important passphrase. If you need some inspiration or coaching on this aspect of security, I suggest you put four minutes of your life into the hands of none other than [John Oliver and Edward Snowden (Facebook video link)](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=687975607998118&pnref=story).

# You're not done yet: Add a PGP key

![Keybase.io: No public key (yet!)]({{site.baseurl}}/files/3_keybase_no_public_key.jpg)
Right about now you're feeling all smug and thinking "I'm one of the cool kids, yo! I got me an alpha Keybase account." But your work doesn't end there: in fact, the journey has only begun...

For some reason that I haven't figure out yet, about one in ten of the people I invite to Keybase stop at the previous step and never actually set-up a public PGP key.
