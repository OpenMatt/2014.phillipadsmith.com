I just thought i'd share a bit about a project CJFE and U of T are working on that you may have heard of -- they released an archive of all the already published Snowden leaks and assembled a bunch of metadata so that they can be sorted by the Â publication that broke them, countries affected, journalist, NSA or other agency codename, etc. The first such collection as far as we know.
