## Building successful open data products by solving a problems
### The story behind 604-670-SCCR

When we arrived at the Vancouver open data day hackathon, we had a great team and a fuzzy idea. When we left more than twelve hours later, we had a great prototype and a fuzzy team. The [hackathon lessons](TK) stayed consistent: TK minimum viable product, get lots of feedback from people in the room, focus on solving a real-world problem (and just one!).

The morning kicked off with an welcome from [OpenDataBC director, Gillan TK]() and an energetic pep talk from open-data advocate, [David Eaves](TK). Eaves, dressed in hack-day chic hoodie, jeans, nerd-tastic spec and runners, encouraged participants to TK, TK, and TK (and did so with surprising enthusiasm, given the early hour). 

From there, it was a standard hack-day agenda: pitch ideas, form teams, build some prototpyes. Teams presented their projects at 8PM to a panel of impressively-attentive (and patient!) judges: [Adam TK](TK), [Andrea TK](TK), TK, TK, and TK. 

Our team -- [Geoff D'auria](TK), [Hugh Stimson](TK), and yours truely -- were comfortably situated at a nearby bar drinking away our prize winnings and telling open-data war stories by 10:30PM.

## Potential 
Beyond youth soccer, to all recreational soccer. Repeat stats about who plays & how big soccer is in the lower mainland BC. 

[As I mused last week](TK), there's an opportunity here to solve a surprising hairball of a data problem: pulling together geographic information about fields, parks as well as their condition, across many municipalities and parks boards, not to mention the challenge ahead of incorporating information about divisions, teams, and game schedules. We could probably have a hack day every Sunday for the next few months without running out of ideas to work on...

I gave the team today off. We'll see if they can be rallied again next weekend. :)

A special thanks to the three mentors who provided TK: [Linda TK from Vancouver's Open Data](TK), [Lorne TK](TK), and [Luke TK from Recollect](TK). Hearing Luke's candid tale of how his open-data side project [Van Trash](TK) quietly became a [juggernaught in the municipal trash collection](TK) space was a particularly big eye-opener for me. All of their comments and suggestions were incredibly helpful.

So, um, go give it a try, eh? Just text a [field or park name](TK) to 604-670-SCCR (7227).
