title: Making government data more accessible in Venezuela
dek: The process of liberating the data from a 150-page PDF and making it useful again

It's hard for me to believe that it has been almost six weeks since cartographic whiz [Hugh Stimson]() and I were in Venezuela [delivering data journalism workshops]() organized by the press freedom monitoring organization [IPYS](). It feels like yesterday that I started hearing from the participants of those workshops about the quickly unfolding and rapidly escalating political situation on the streets of cities throughout the country that followed just days after our departure. TK.

Hugh and I will be delivering that same bootcamp-style workshop again this summer in Vancouver as part of [The Tyee's Master Class learning series](http://thetyee.ca/MasterClass/Spring2014/Data-Bootcamp/). Fine-tuned for the needs of data-hungry journalists, researchers, activists and anyone with a story to tell in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Canada more broadly, the two-day hands-on workshop will guide participants through the entire workflow of their own personal data project. Like in Venezuela, the workshop will conclude with participants presenting their completed projects.

To give people a sense of what that experience looks like, I'm going to share the process that [Emilia Diaz-Struck](http://) and I went through to take records acquired from the Venezuelan government body CADIVI (Comisión de Administración de Divisas/Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange), originally a 150-page PDF document with more than 10,000 rows of data, and to [make it available as a searchable "database" online](http://phillipadsmith.github.io/cadivi/).

* **Searching for data:** Where is the data we want?
* **Checking the data:** Is this the data we want?
* **Extracting the data:** Getting the data into a more manipulation-friendly format
* **Cleaning the data:** Every step of the way, saved a new version of the data with a descriptive name. 

Currency formatting issues: Working with the currency figures in Open Office to correct for formatting issues.
Data extraction issues: Looking for outliers in the RIF column 
Data validation: Highlighting rows where the figures did not add up in Google Spreadsheets. Rounding error was the culprit for most.

At this pint, we had  10,374 rows of clean data about what companies had asked for and received US dollars from the government through the currency control body! Now what? A quick search for CADIVI on Twitter will illustrate just how contentious this system of currency control is, so it wasn't a stretch to believe that making it available online in a searchable and sortable format might help people to  better understand how it works, what companies are able to exchange Bolivars for dollars and so on.
