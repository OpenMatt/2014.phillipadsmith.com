Iâ€™ve been consulting in one form or another <a href='http://ca.linkedin.com/in/phillipadsmith/' title='My irregularly-updated profile on LinkedIn'>for almost two decades</a>. I love helping people solve difficult challenges. I started out as a new media producer. Then I followed my heart and my politics and became an online advocacy specialist. Later, I realized that change is difficult without an independent media, so I started working with publishers. Now, I focus on \"news innovation\": the technology & ideas that are shaping how users interact with journalism online."

Occasionally, I write things down about this obsession, and &mdash; even more occasionally &mdash; some nice people publish those ideas online. I've written for publications like <a href='http://www.pbs.org/idealab'>PBS MediaShift's Idea Lab</a>, <a href='http://thetyee.ca/Bios/Phillip_Smith/'>The Tyee</a>, and <a href='http://newint.org/contributors/phillip-smith/'>New Internationalist</a>, and professional associations like Magazines Canada and the Alberta Magazine Publishers Association.
