h1. Bricolage for really, really smart people.

h3. The only web publishing system that doesn't think it's smarter than you are.

* No boilerplate themes to restrict your creativity
* No assumptions about how you want your site to work
* No wasted time figuring out "The Right Way" to do it

h4. Stop trying to hack your way out of someone else's paper bag, and start enjoying total freedom.

h1. Bricolage > Hello, world.

h1. Bricolage > Running Bricolage (not for the faint of heart).

* Apache2
* mod_perl2
* PostgreSQL or MySQL
* Most of CPAN!

Seriosly, it's not that hard to install. Consider it a right of passage. :) (And, if you're lazy, just grab the virtual machine image.)

h1. Bricolage > Five reasons you will love it.

* Pure Perl solution for enterprise content management
* Limitless potential with document modelling 
* Output Channels: FTP, sFTP, Webdav, etc.
* Templating: There's more than one way to do it
* Powertools: Bric::SOAP, CPAN, LDAP, etc.

h1. Bricolage > Pure Perl solution

* Writen in Perl
* Perlish API
* Templating system is Perl

h1. Bricolage > WTF is an "enterprise" solution? 

AFAIK, Bricolage is the only pure Perl solution for enterprise content management. 

* Bricolage > 10 years old: very, very stable.
* Check out the SLOC on Oloh: It's impressive.
* Managing sites with > 100,000 documents && > 100 Editors

h1. Bricolage > Document Modelling ftw!

* Think of a complex document that you need to publish to the Web
* How many individual elements make up that document? 
* How do you make it easy for non-technical folks to create these complex document types? 
* Welcome to Bricolage elements: It's like Drupal's CCK, MT's & Wordpress' "custom fields", or Plone's content types on steriods. Better yet, it's recursive! 

h1. Bricolage > Output channels? Output anything!

* Bricolage is a **workflow** system, not a content delivery system
* Bricolage publishing content _to_ a front-end server or service
* Output Channels make it possible to output anything. Seriously!

Examples: html, xml, JSON, PDFs, or post to an API. Anything goes, just like Perl.

h1. Bricolage > Templating 

There's more than one way to do it:

* HTML::Mason
* Template::Toolkit
* Template::Declare
* Even PHP! (Not for beginners.)

h1. Bricolage > The power tools you need built right in

* Load any CPAN module right from the bricolage.conf (and then use it in your templates, duh!)
* Pluggable authentication: LDAP, and those other ones. 

Last, but not least: Bric::SOAP! A powerful way to interact with Bricolage from the command line, other programs, and so on.
